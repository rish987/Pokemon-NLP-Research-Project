- classify instances rather than descriptors
- features:
    - the preceding word is a possessive
    - the word is a possessive
    - word contains a common name
    - word contains an animal name
    - word contains a building type
    - word contains a biome name
	- for each of the labels:
		- a surrounding word contains this label


- realistically:
    - possession weighting based in part on lexical distance
    - identification of noun as subject or object of a verb
        - search left for "by," assign weight to right/left based on how
          many words were encountered along way to "by" divided by the total
          number of words prior to the noun in the sentence
            - TODO improve confidence measure
        - then look for verb on right side of the noun
            - if found, assign "subject" to noun multiplied by weight
              previously determined
    - passive voice weighting
        - based on how far away the passive voice
          identifier is located

  Ash used [Bulbasaur] next and it swiftly used its [Vine Whip] attack
      ^^^^                                 ^^^^  

IDEAL
Ash:
[ used_act: 1, used_tar: 0 ]
Bulbasaur:
[ used_act: 1, used_tar: 1 ]
Vine Whip:
[ used_act: 0, used_tar: 1 ]

REAL
Bulbasaur:
[ used_act: 0.91, used_tar: 0.09 ]
Vine Whip:
[ used_act: 0.12, used_tar: 0.88 ]


- ideally:
	- extract entire sentence for use as context for each instance
    - for each pronoun (he, she, they, it):
        - does the sentence replace the descriptor with this pronoun?
    - for each possesive pronoun (his, her, their, its):
        - does the sentence use this possesive pronoun to identify a 
        possesion of the descriptor?
    - for each common verb:
        - is this descriptor a recipient of this action?
        - does this descriptor perform this action?

- confidence measure?
- identify active/passive voice?

  [Vine Whip] was swiftly used by the large, dappled-green [Bulbasaur]
