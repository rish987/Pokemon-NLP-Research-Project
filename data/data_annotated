In a massive stadium, two creatures known as [Pokémon] are having a battle, directed by the [Trainers] to give it their all. One of the [Pokémon], a [Gengar], uses its [Hypnosis] attack on its opponent, a [Nidorino], causing it to fall asleep. [Nidorino]'s [Trainer] recalls it and sends out another [Pokémon], [Onix] to battle. The massive [Rock] Snake [Pokémon] emerges from its [[Poké] Ball] and prepares to take on [Gengar], at which point it is revealed that the battle is being displayed on television. Its viewer is a boy named [[Ash] [Ketchum]] who lives in a small settlement called [Pallet Town] and is ten-years old which allows him to pick a starter [Pokémon] and become a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]]. [Ash] declares to himself (and the [Pokémon] of the world) that he will become a [[Pokémon] Master]. His speech, however, is interrupted by his mom who tells him to get to bed as he has a big day tomorrow. [Ash] protests that he's too excited to sleep, so his mom tells him if he won't sleep then to at least get ready for the next day as she switches on a program hosted by the town's [Pokémon] expert, [Professor [Oak]]. [Ash] watches as [Oak] explains that new [Trainers] get to pick one of three [Pokémon] to start their journey; the [[Grass]-type] [Bulbasaur], the [[Fire]-type] [Charmander] or the [[Water]-type] [Squirtle].
As [Ash] sleeps, he goes over the choices in his head reasoning that any of the three available [Pokémon] are good for starting [Trainers]. However his [Voltorb] alarm clock rolls into his hand as he sleeps and, dreaming that he's throwing a [[Poké] Ball], chucks it onto the wall, smashing it. When [Ash] finally wakes up, he sees the sun high in the sky and realizes he overslept. [Ash] runs to the lab, in such a hurry he doesn't change out of his pyjamas, and at this point doesn't care which starter he gets as long as he gets any. He arrives at the lab just in time to see one of his new fellow [Trainers] (and [Professor [Oak]]'s grandson), [Gary], leaving. Unfortunately for [Ash], [Gary] is very overconfident and brags that he was on time and already has his first [Pokémon] although he refuses to reveal which one he got. [Gary]'s large crowd (which includes a group of cheerleaders) cheers for him, and [Gary] promises that he'll become a [[Pokémon] Master] and put [Pallet Town] on the map before leaving. As the crowd follows, [Ash] is left by himself but not for long as [Professor [Oak]] approaches. [Ash] apologizes for being late (and hardly being dressed for the occasion) but tells [Professor [Oak]] he's ready to pick his first [Pokémon].
Taken into the lab, [Ash] sees three [[Poké] Balls] sitting on a pedestal and states that after thinking about it he's decided to choose [Squirtle] as his starter, however the [[Poké] Ball] is empty. [Oak] explains that [Squirtle] has already been claimed by a [Trainer] that was on time. [Ash] doesn't mind as he decides to instead go with [Bulbasaur], whom has also been taken already. [Ash] is still happy to go with [Charmander] but, alas, that [Pokémon] is gone too with someone who wasn't late. [Ash] asks if this means there are no [Pokémon] left for him, and [Oak] tells him this isn't exactly true as he does have another [Pokémon] but it is very unusual. At this point, [Ash] is willing to settle for anything and tells [Oak] he'll take whatever it is. A fourth [[Poké] Ball] emerges onto the pedestal and [Ash] picks it up, upon which point it opens and from it emerges a small yellow mouse-like [Pokémon]. [Oak] explains that the [Pokémon] is named [Pikachu], and [Ash] is very impressed deciding [Pikachu] is better than any of the other starters. He picks up [Pikachu] and hugs it, however [Pikachu] doesn't like being hugged and gives [Ash] a massive electric shock as [Oak] explains that [Pikachu] is an [[Electric]-type], and has a shocking personality to match. [Oak] gives [Ash] some [[Poké] Balls] and a [Pokédex], however at this point [Pikachu] shocks them both. 
Heading outside, [Ash] finds his mom and a small group of supporters outside ready to wish him luck as he heads out on his [Pokémon] journey. [Ash]'s mom gets weepy at the thought of her son finally leaving to start his life as a trainer, before then starting to list the numerous supplies she's packed for him before he goes before noticing [Pikachu] and asking why he isn't inside his [[Poké] Ball] like other [Pokémon]. [Ash] realizes she's right and tells [Pikachu] to go inside, but [Pikachu] refuses constantly returning the ball. [Ash]'s mom simply assumes the two are playing catch but admits she finds [Pikachu] 'weird'. [Pikachu] doesn't take kindly to this comment and shocks everyone in the area except [Professor [Oak]] who remarks that the rubber gloves that were packed will come in handy since rubber doesn't conduct electricity.
[Ash] and [Pikachu] begin their long journey walking beyond the outskirts of [Pallet Town]... or rather, [Ash] (wearing the rubber gloves) is walking while [Pikachu], who is tied to a clothesline like a leash, has to be literally dragged along. [Ash] tries talking to [Pikachu], but all he learns is that the [Pokémon] can only say its name and doesn't like him at all. Trying to persuade [Pikachu] to go inside his [[Poké] Ball], [Ash] consults his [Pokédex] but it confirms that while many [Pokémon] travel in [[Poké] Balls] some don't like being confined. Deciding to make life easier for [Pikachu], [Ash] removes the leash and rubber gloves but [Pikachu] still isn't impressed. Just then the two hear footsteps behind them and find they're close to a [Pidgey]. [Ash] looks up [Pidgey] in the [Pokédex] and finds that the small bird is a flying-type [Pokémon] which is gentle, easy to catch and a good choice for a beginning trainer. [Ash] is happy at the chance to test [Pikachu]'s skills and tries to send him to battle but [Pikachu] refuses instead deciding to climb a tree and watch. [Ash], angry at [Pikachu]'s continuing disobedience, decides to do it himself and throws a [[Poké] Ball] at [Pidgey]. The ball connects and [Pidgey] is drawn inside, leading [Ash] to think he's captured it. However the [[Poké] Ball] shakes for a few seconds before [Pidgey] escapes, and the [Pokédex] explains that when catching a [Pokémon] you normally have your own [Pokémon] battle to weaken the target first. [Pikachu] finds [Ash] ineptitude hilarious while [Ash] gets more worked up, determined to show [Pikachu] what he can do. He decides to try sneaking up on [Pidgey] with his pajama shirt, but when he covers it the [Pokémon] unleashes its [Gust] and [Sand Attack] in response. [Ash] is sent crashing to the ground and [Pidgey] flies away. As [Ash] bemoans his bad luck, he then notices another [Pokémon] rifling through his bag. He chases it away as the [Pokédex] identifies it as [Rattata], a normal-type that lives in the forest. When [Ash] states that they're not in a forest, the [Pokédex] goes on to explain that occasionally [Rattata] will emerge to steal food from stupid travellers. 
As [Pikachu] laughs further, [Ash] notices some more [Pidgey] nearby and throws a stone at them in frustration. Just then he spots what he thinks is a lone [Pidgey] nearby and is determined to finally catch this one. He throws another stone and it makes a direct hit... only it turns out not to be a [Pidgey] but instead a much angrier looking bird-type [Pokémon]. [Ash] scans it with his [Pokédex] and it identifies the bird as [Spearow] which, unlike [Pidgey], has a bad attitude and a violent temperament being known for attacking people and [Pokémon] without warning. [Ash] then sees [Spearow] flying directly at him, however as it passes [Spearow] spots [Pikachu] in a tree and decides to attack him instead. The [Pokédex] explains that wild [Pokémon] are sometimes jealous of those with trainers, and as [Ash] tries to get [Spearow] to focus on him again instead [Spearow] nearly knocks [Pikachu] out of the tree at which point the [Electric] Mouse unleashes electricity at his attacker which sends [Spearow] falling to the ground.
[Spearow] is down, but it's not out and it lets out a loud cry. In the distance, [Ash] and [Pikachu] spot a large flock of [Spearow] emerging from a tree and heading straight towards them. The two decide to make a run for it, and quickly try to get away as the furious flock give chase. [Ash] promises to protect [Pikachu], however [Pikachu] runs on ahead of [Ash] which makes it an easy target for [Spearow] since they don't hesitate in attacking en masse. By the time [Ash] catches up, [Pikachu] is very weak and can no longer run, so [Ash] picks his [Pokémon] and carries him away. The two come to a fast flowing river and [Ash], needing to get away from the still angry [Spearow] quickly, jumps in and allows himself and [Pikachu] to be swept away, during which he very nearly becomes lunch for a [Gyarados].
Further down the river, where there's no current, a young girl is enjoying a leisurely fish when the lure starts to react. The girl quickly grabs her rod to reel in what she thinks will be a big one, but instead yanks out [Ash] and [Pikachu]. She is disappointed, but then notices [Pikachu]'s condition and tells angrily tells [Ash] he should never let his [Pokémon] get into such a bad condition. She tells him that [Pikachu] needs to get treatment right away explaining that there's a [[Pokémon] [Centre]] (a medical centre that specialises in healing [Pokémon]) nearby. As she points out the direction [Ash] needs to go, he notices the flock of [Spearow] has caught up. [Ash] decides to make a getaway on the girl's bike (putting [Pikachu] in the basket) despite her protests, promising that he'll eventually give it back much to her anger.
As [Ash] rides for dear life, a thunderstorm starts. With rain falling and the [Spearow] flock still on his tail, [Ash] rides as fast as he can. However the [Spearow] catch up and start to attack him, and this coupled with the dangerous conditions eventually cause [Ash] to fly off a small bank crashing to the ground. Lying in the mud, [Ash] spots [Pikachu] nearby weaker than ever. Upset that his first day as a [Pokémon] trainer has turned into such a disaster, [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to get inside his [[Poké] Ball] as it seems to be the only way he can be safe from the approaching [Spearow]. Deciding he's done running, [Ash] stands before the [Spearow] and announces that he refuses to be beaten by the likes of them if he's going to be a [[Pokémon] Master], vowing to defeat them all. [Pikachu] sees that [Ash] is willing to sacrifice himself to save him and, just before the [Spearow] flock can hit, jumps onto his shoulder then into the air. [Pikachu] is struck by lightning causing him to let out a massive [[Thunder] Shock] which throws [Ash] back onto the ground.
Soon, the rain has cleared and the sun is shining. [Ash] and [Pikachu] are lying unconscious near the smouldering remains of the bike they stole. The two wake up and find the [Spearow] flock has gone. The two weakly note that despite everything, they managed to defeat their attackers together and finally a friendship is formed. Just then a shimmering golden [Pokémon] flies overhead towards a rainbow. [Ash] wonders what it was, and the [Pokédex] can't identify it but explains that there's many [Pokémon] species yet to be discovered. After watching the [Pokémon] disappear into the distance, [Ash] picks up [Pikachu] and keeps on walking as the narrator explains that [Ash] and [Pikachu] have many more adventures together to come. Reaching a bank, [Ash] spots [[Viridian] City] in the distance and heads towards it having taken the first of many steps on his [Pokémon] journey.


As [Ash] arrives in [[Viridian] City], he is stopped by an [Officer Jenny], who gives him a ride to the [[Pokémon] Center] after his [Pokédex] confirms his identity. While [Nurse Joy] is attending to [Pikachu]'s injuries, [Ash] calls his mother and [Professor [Oak]], the latter of whom is surprised to discover that [Ash] is already in [[Viridian] City]. When [Ash] mentions the strange golden [Pokémon] he had recently seen, [Professor [Oak]] is skeptical that [Ash] had actually seen an unidentified [Pokémon].
Afterwards, the girl whose bicycle was "borrowed" by [Ash] storms into the [[Pokémon] Center] and rages at [Ash] for what his [Pikachu] did to it. When [Ash] explains what happened, the girl's concern shifts to [Pikachu]'s well-being.
At that moment, an alarm in the [[Pokémon] Center] sounds and a villainous group named [Team Rocket] invades the building, recites their motto, and tries to steal all of the [Pokémon] in the center. [Nurse Joy] begins transporting as many [Pokémon] as she can to the [[Pokémon] Center] in [Pewter City] while [Ash] tries and fails to fend off [Ekans] and [Koffing] with a [Rattata] and [Pidgey] contained inside [[Poké] Balls] that have been knocked to the floor. The girl, named [Misty], tries to help with her [Goldeen], but it is unable to do more than flail helplessly due to the lack of water.
[Ash] tries to flee with [Pikachu]'s stretcher, but [Pikachu] suddenly wakes up from running into [Misty]'s bicycle. The other [Pikachu] at the [[Pokémon] Center] surround [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]], healing him as well as delivering a powerful electric shock to [Team Rocket]. Using power from [Ash] pedaling the burned bicycle, [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] hits [Team Rocket] with a powerful [[Thunder] Shock] attack that, after getting mixed with [Koffing]'s gas, results in a colossal explosion that destroys much of the [[Pokémon] Center].
Following these events, [Team Rocket] decides that [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] is no ordinary [Pikachu] and make it their mission to capture him for their boss. They are sent blasting off when a piece of debris punctures their [Meowth]-shaped balloon while [Ash], [Pikachu], and [Misty] continue to the [[Viridian] Forest], with [Misty] having decided to follow [Ash] until he replaces her destroyed bicycle. The episode ends with [Ash] spotting a [Caterpie] and preparing to catch it.


The episode picks up right where the previous one left off, as [Ash] prepares to capture a [Caterpie] in [[Viridian] Forest]. He immediately tosses a [[Poké] Ball] at [Caterpie], who tries to break free but is unsuccessful. [Ash]'s excitement takes control as he celebrates catching his first [Pokémon], holding the [[Poké] Ball] and running in circles out of joy. When [Ash] holds the [[Poké] Ball] closer to [Misty]'s face, she reveals that she has a fear of bugs, even if they are contained in a [[Poké] Ball]. However, [Pikachu] is happy to have [Caterpie] along, and [Ash] decides to bring [Caterpie] out, scaring [Misty] away. Despite her fear, [Caterpie] wants to make friends with [Misty], but the latter would much rather get to know [Pikachu] better.
[Misty] continues to complain about [Caterpie] and says to put "one of the three most disgusting things" back into the [[Poké] Ball]. When [Ash] asks about the others, [Misty] remarks "[Carrots], peppers, and bugs." [Ash], however, is offended at how [Misty]'s discomfort is used to hurt [Caterpie]'s feelings. [Ash] reassures [Caterpie] and continues traveling without [Misty]. [Misty], however, has other plans, as she is still upset about her ruined bicycle and wants [Ash] to replace it. Because of this, she continues following [Ash].
Later that night, [Ash] sets up camp for the night. [Misty], also getting ready to go to sleep, exchanges a few smart remarks with [Ash], upsetting [Pikachu] and [Caterpie]. While [Ash] and [Misty] sleep, [Pikachu] and [Caterpie] get to know each other a little better. In the morning, [Misty] is still frightened of [Caterpie], panicking so much that the [Pokémon] becomes subdued and returns himself to his [[Poké] Ball]. Although [Ash] is angry about this, his attention is diverted when he spots a wild [Pidgeotto].
Wanting to catch [Pidgeotto], [Ash] throws a [[Poké] Ball], but [Pidgeotto] simply swats it away. [Misty] retorts that a [Trainer] needs to battle and weaken a wild [Pokémon] to capture it. However, when she mentions that he caught [Caterpie] only because it was weak, the remark irritates [Ash] to the point where he blindly summons [Caterpie] to battle. He does this without knowing that [Caterpie] is at a type disadvantage against [Pidgeotto], though both [Misty] and [Pikachu] know. As a result, [Caterpie] is thoroughly beaten up by [Pidgeotto], but [Ash] recalls [Caterpie] just in time, causing [Pidgeotto] to get its beak stuck in a tree.
[Ash] sends [Pikachu] after [Pidgeotto] just as it frees itself. [Pikachu] uses [[Thunder] Shock] to hit [Pidgeotto], weakening it and allowing [Ash] to toss a [[Poké] Ball]. The Ball takes [Pidgeotto] in and drops to the ground, rocking. After a few moments, the Ball ceases movement; [Ash] has captured the [Pidgeotto]. Despite the success, [Misty] continues to berate him for his lack of knowledge about strategy.
[Team Rocket] intrudes on their argument, reciting their motto. They decide to target his [Pikachu], mentioning his incredible power, which causes them to become distracted in a short internal argument before they decide to attack. They then send out [Koffing] and [Ekans] to battle, despite a double-team being unfair. [Misty] wants to jump in, but [Ash] does not want to break the rules. [Koffing]'s [Sludge] attack blinds [Pikachu], taking him out of the battle. While he hands [Pikachu] off to [Misty], he decides to send out his newly caught [Pidgeotto].
[Pidgeotto] dodges both [Koffing] and [Ekans]'s attacks before going into a [Quick Attack]. [Ekans] avoids the attack by going underground, forcing [Pidgeotto] to come to a sudden stop. [Koffing] fires a [Smog] attack, which [Pidgeotto] splits with its wings before dodging multiple [Sludge] attacks and [Ekans]'s retaliation. Despite soaring high into the sky, both [Ekans] and [Koffing] are able to keep up with [Pidgeotto]. [Pidgeotto] tries to hit [Koffing] with [Gust], but misses and is defeated. [Ash] recalls [Pidgeotto] and tries to fight [Team Rocket] with his fists, but [James] easily holds him back.
It looks bad for [Ash], but he decides to send out [Caterpie] to battle. The sight of the bug simply amuses [Team Rocket] as they prepare to attack. [Caterpie] looks down, when [Ash] orders him to fire [String Shot]. The attack completely incapacitates [Koffing] before [Caterpie] muzzles [Ekans]. [Caterpie] rushes into a [Tackle] attack on [Koffing], sending it into [Ekans] and thus taking them both out, shocking everyone. [Meowth] tries to step in, but he is also wrapped in [String Shot]. Taken by surprise, [Team Rocket] flees, but promises that they will be back.
[Ash] congratulates [Caterpie] on coming through, and urges [Misty] to do the same. She agrees to pat [Caterpie] on the head, despite her initial discomfort. At that moment, [Caterpie] begins to spray mist from his mouth, startling her. [Ash] puts [Caterpie] down as the mist covers [Caterpie], signaling evolution. [Caterpie] evolves into [Metapod], and [Ash]'s [Pokédex] notes that it has reached this stage more quickly than any other [Caterpie] on record. In addition, [Misty] shows approval of [Ash]'s strengthening bonds with his [Pokémon]. Despite having fewer reservations about [Metapod], the sight of a [Beedrill] scares [Misty] as she looks forward to quickly leaving the forest. [Ash] is in no such hurry, however, as he seeks to capture more [Pokémon].


As [Ash], [Misty] and [Pikachu] continue on their way through [[Viridian] Forest], a shrill scream disrupts the calm of the trees and the [Beedrill]. [Ash] turns around, realizing that the sound came from his female companion. She is hiding in a tree because she has seen a bug, to which [Ash] suggests it to be a cowterpie. Then he spots the bug, a [Weedle], and decides to catch it. He tries to use [Pikachu] against it, but since he is asleep, he sends out his [Pidgeotto] instead. [Pidgeotto] manages to defeat [Weedle], but, just when [Ash] is about to toss a [[Poké] Ball], a boy dressed as a samurai arrives. The samurai asks [Ash] if he is from [Pallet Town], and when [Ash] says he is, the samurai challenges [Ash] to a [Pokémon] battle. The wild [Weedle] escapes and [Ash] reprimands the samurai for causing him to lose the [Weedle], but the samurai says [Ash] allowed it to escape. The two then begin their [Pokémon] battle.
[Ash] uses his [Pidgeotto] and the samurai battles with his [Pinsir]. The two battle for some time, but [Pinsir] manages to defeat [Pidgeotto]. [Ash] then sends out his [Metapod]. [Metapod] breaks [Pinsir]'s pincers with [Harden], winning the round. The samurai then sends out his own [Metapod]! The two [Metapod] continue to harden themselves, leaving [Misty] and [Pikachu] wondering if the match will ever end. Suddenly, a swarm of [Beedrill] angrily interrupt and kidnap [[Ash]'s [Metapod]]. [Ash] tries to recall [Metapod], but he misses and it gets away. The samurai takes [Ash], [Misty] and their [Pokémon] to a safe place.
In the samurai's hiding place, the samurai furiously rebukes [Ash] for putting his [Metapod] in danger. [Ash] keeps quiet, and promises himself that he will find [Metapod] the next day and look after him better from then on. During the night, he is unable to sleep and can only think about his [Metapod].
Early the next morning, [Ash] begins his search for [Metapod]. He sees him lying at the base of a tree, surrounded by many [Kakuna], and attempts to sneak forward through the grass towards him without alerting the [Beedrill] swarm. However, he is interrupted by [Meowth], who jumps on the back of his head. A moment later, [Jessie] and [James] appear on a cliff overhead, and launch loudly into their motto, ignoring [Ash]'s warnings that they will alert the [Beedrill].
Sure enough, the sound awakens the [Kakuna], which evolve into [Beedrill] and prepare to dive-bomb [Ash] and [Team Rocket]. [Ash] runs forward below their attacks, reaching the tree where [Metapod] is waiting. [Jessie] and [James] attempt to take cover from the [Beedrill] beneath a large protective tank they have been carrying, but, as it is made of cardboard, a group of [Weedle] are easily able to chew through it.
[Ash] attempts to recall [Metapod] to his [[Poké] Ball], but he rolls away from his arms. Seeing a look of sorrow in [Metapod]'s eyes, [Ash] realizes that he has lost [Metapod]'s trust. [Ash] attempts to explain what happened, saying that losing [Metapod] was all [Samurai]'s fault. However, [Ash] suddenly realizes that he is lying to himself and to [Metapod], and admits that losing [Metapod] was his fault and his alone. [Ash] is upset upon realizing that it was his carelessness that put his [Pokémon]'s life in danger, and, amid tearful apologies to [Metapod], he sincerely promises to take better care of him. His faith in his [Trainer] restored, [Metapod] saves [Ash] by leaping into the path of an attacking [Beedrill], but in the process his shell is torn by the [Beedrill]'s needle-like arm. [Ash] picks up his [Metapod] and cradles him in his arms, thinking he has been badly injured, but he instead begins to glow; the hole in his shell has triggered [Metapod]'s evolution into [Butterfree]. [Ash] gazes happily at his first fully-evolved [Pokémon], and even [Misty] doesn't feel her normal fear of bugs, going so far as to call [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] beautiful.
[Ash] and the others are then once again attacked by the swarm of [Beedrill], but, this time, [Ash] is prepared for them. He orders his newly evolved [Butterfree] to use [[Sleep] Powder], which puts the bee-like [Pokémon] to sleep and allows the group to escape. [Samurai] applauds [Ash] for being able to control his [Butterfree] well so soon after its evolution. [Samurai] also tells [Ash] that he takes back the statements he made about [Ash] being a novice, and that, compared to [Ash], [Samurai] is the novice.
[Ash] and [Samurai] part as friends, promising to battle again someday. [Ash], [Pikachu] and [Misty] then go on and finally reach the end of [[Viridian] Forest]. [Ash] runs at full speed towards [Pewter City] to earn his first [[Gym] [Badge]], with [Misty] following close behind. [Team Rocket], meanwhile, are left wrapped up like [Kakuna] among a hive of angry [Beedrill].


The episode begins with [Team Rocket] digging a hole, falling into it as soon as they forget where it was dug. Meanwhile, [Ash], [Misty], and [Pikachu] reach the edge of [[Viridian] Forest] and arrive on the outskirts of [Pewter City]. As [Ash] takes a rest sitting on some rocks, he and [Misty] meet a mysterious man named [Flint]. [Ash], [Misty], and [Pikachu] head to the [[Pokémon] Center], where [Ash] is surprised to encounter [Nurse Joy] again. She explains that she is not the [[Viridian] City] Joy as [Ash] was obviously inclined to believe, but her older sister. She then shows [Ash] a poster promoting a tournament called the [[Pokémon] League] Championship and he decides to sign up. Before he can enter, however, he needs to defeat eight [[Pokémon] [Gym]] Leaders and earn from each a [[Gym] [Badge]] as proof of his victory. [Flint] walks in at this point and tells [Ash] about [Pewter City]'s [[Gym] Leader], [Brock]. He is openly skeptical of [Ash]'s chances of winning, and laughs scornfully at the very thought of it. Later, when [Misty] warns [Ash] of [[Gym] Leaders]' prodigious skill and offers him advice, she becomes angry when he declines.
[Ash] stops by the [[Pokémon] Center] again to pick up his healed team before making his way to the [Pewter [Gym]]. When he arrives, he meets the [[Gym] Leader], [Brock], and challenges him to a battle. In the [Pewter [Gym]], battles are two against two. [Ash] begins the match with [Pikachu] while [Brock] starts off with [Onix]. [Pikachu] is intimidated by the giant [Pokémon] and doesn't want to battle, but [Ash] responds by telling [Pikachu] that this is his battle. [Pikachu]'s [[Thunder] Shock] is woefully ineffective and [Brock] commands [Onix] to counter with [Bind]. It begins to crush [Pikachu], inflicting very visible pain. This prompts [Ash] to recall [Pikachu], only to have the attempt thwarted by the larger [Pokémon]'s bulk. [Ash] cannot bear to watch his friend suffer any more agony, and he forfeits the match.
As a dejected [Ash] leaves the [Gym], he encounters [Flint] again, who suggests that [Ash] follow him to his home. [Ash] agrees, and, over a batch of tea, they discuss what happened in the [Gym]. [Flint] notices that [Ash] is obviously upset over his loss, so he consoles him with the knowledge that [Brock] could be an even better [Trainer] than he already is. [Ash] becomes confused by this, but [Flint] refuses to elaborate. Instead, he leads [Ash] outside and gestures across the way to another house. The two watch as [Brock], in a pink apron, cares for his nine little brothers and sisters. As they walk away, [Flint] explains that after [Brock]'s good-for-nothing father left home to become a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]], his heartbroken mother abandoned them, leaving the eldest child, [Brock] to take care of his siblings. [Ash] feels sympathy for [Brock], but is determined to defeat him nonetheless. [Flint] recognizes [Ash]'s determination and mentions that he might know of a way [Ash] can super-charge [Pikachu].
[Flint] and [Ash] travel to a hydro-electric plant, where [Flint] hooks up the generator to the electric sacs in [Pikachu]'s cheeks. As the river is bone-dry, [Ash] must run on a large water wheel to generate the electricity, which flows into [Pikachu]. [Misty] shows up and offers to lend [Ash] her [[Water]-type] [Pokémon], but [Ash] refuses, wanting to defeat [Brock] with his own team. He continues charging [Pikachu] until the generator overloads and [Pikachu]'s electricity lights up the night sky. The next day, [Ash] returns with confidence to the [Pewter City] [Gym] for a rematch. [Brock] is also confident after his easy victory in the last battle, and the two quickly start the rematch. [Brock] sends out [Geodude], while [Ash] sends out [Pidgeotto]. However, the [Normal]- and [[Flying]-type] [Pokémon] cannot hurt [Geodude], and the [[Rock]-type] knocks [Pidgeotto] out. [Ash] recalls it and sends out [Pikachu]. [Misty] is watching in the rafters, cheering for [Ash], only to be crowded by [Brock]'s siblings, all of whom are cheering for their older brother.
[Brock] comments on how weak [Pikachu] and [Ash] are, and [Ash] retorts by commanding [Pikachu]'s attack, which easily knocks [Geodude] down. Both [Brock] and [Misty] are stunned at this. [Brock] recalls his [Geodude] and sends out [Onix], and a fearful [Pikachu] tries to do another [Electric] attack, damaging the [Gym] himself instead. [Onix] wraps [Pikachu] with [Bind], but [Pikachu] makes a comeback with his new attack, [Thunderbolt], which manages to hurt [Onix] but still isn't enough to take it out. Just as [Pikachu] is about to pass out, [Brock] suddenly spares it by calling [Onix] off. He tells [Ash] to forfeit again before any more harm comes to [Pikachu]. [Ash] protests, wanting to finish the battle.
Suddenly, the [Gym]'s sprinklers are set off by a fire caused by [Pikachu]'s earlier [Electric] attack. [Water] sprays all over [Onix], weakening it and allowing [Pikachu] to fight back with another [Electric] attack. Just as [Ash] is about to command [Pikachu] to finish [Onix] off, [Brock]'s brothers and sisters all crowd [Ash] and beg him to stop. [Brock] orders his brothers and sisters to not get involved, but they protest, knowing that [Brock]'s love of [Pokémon] would make it painful for him to continue the match and watch his [Onix] get hurt further. At this, [Ash] calls back his [Pikachu]. He explains that if he defeated [Brock] now, it would only be because of the sprinklers being set off. He decides he wants to win his [Badge] fair and square, much to [Misty]'s disappointment, since he is giving up a lucky advantage.
[Ash] leaves the [Pewter [Gym]], and, on his way out of [Pewter City], he apologizes to [Pikachu] for being so tough. Then, he hears someone calling him, and he turns to find [Brock] running to catch up with him. Surprisingly, [Brock] gives him the [Boulder [Badge]]. [Ash] doesn't want to accept the [Badge], but [Brock] insists that [Ash] has earned it through his kindness to [Pokémon]. [Brock] continues to explain that rather than becoming a great [[Pokémon] [Trainer]], his dream is to become a great [[Pokémon] [Breeder]], but can't do so because of his family duties. He gives [Ash] the [Badge], and asks him to fulfill his dream, to which [Ash] agrees.
Suddenly, [Flint] shows up again, and reveals that he is [Brock]'s "good-for-nothing" father. He explains that he avoided returning to his family as a failure of a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]]. [Ash] puzzles over the fact that [Flint] helped him instead of his son, [Brock], and [Flint] explains that [Ash]'s helplessness reminded him of himself. [Flint] is ready to take back the responsibilities that he abandoned, which [Brock] returns to him, along with a long list of tasks for him to remember while taking care of the children. That evening, [Ash] and [Brock] travel on the road out of [Pewter City]. [Brock] asks to make sure that it is okay that he joins [Ash] on his [Pokémon] journey, and [Ash] insists that he is glad to have him along. However, [Misty] is a different story, and from several paces behind she yells at him to not forget about her bicycle. [Ash] and [Pikachu], followed by [Brock], run ahead to try and get away from [Misty], while she remains in pursuit.
[Team Rocket] shows up at the end for a final cameo, finally managing to burst out of their self-made tomb via a power drill, only to end up trampled by [Ash] and his friends as they run over the hole in the ground, unaware of the people underfoot.


[Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] are hiking toward [Mt. Moon], talking about the legend of a meteor called the "[Moon Stone]". Apparently, the [Moon Stone] crashed into the mountain in prehistoric times. Near the foot of the mountain, they encounter a man being attacked by a flock of [Zubat]. [Misty] reminds [Ash] that the man needs help, and [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to use [[Thunder] Shock]. The [Zubat] fly away, and the man, who is wearing a lab coat, thanks [Ash] profusely. He introduces himself as [Seymour], a scientist. He is upset because someone has installed strung lights inside the nearby cave that are disrupting the [Pokémon] who live inside - not just the [Zubat], but the [Paras] and [Sandshrew] as well.
[Seymour] explains that he believes that the attackers are after the [Moon Stone]. He says that it is a massive boulder, believed to be a million years old or more, and hidden deep in the caves under the mountain. Fragments of the Stone are said to increase a [Pokémon]'s power. [Seymour] theorizes that this is because the native [Pokémon] came from outer space, and the [Moon Stone] was their spacecraft—which means the Stone belongs to the [Pokémon], and that the humans must leave it alone. At that moment, a [Clefairy] bounces past, carrying something. [Ash] scans it on his [Pokédex] and decides to catch it, but [Seymour] tells him to leave it alone. The [Clefairy] is trapped by [Meowth], who is in turn challenged by [Ash]. [Brock] and [Ash] agree that they have to stop [Team Rocket], before they make any more trouble.
[Team Rocket] freely admits to putting up the lights; [Meowth] even reveals their plan to steal the [Moon Stone]. [Ash] and [Brock] challenge [Jessie] and [James], resulting in a battle pitting [[Jessie]'s [Ekans]] and [[James]'s [Koffing]] against [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] and [Brock]'s new [Zubat], caught at the entrance to the cave. [James] orders [Koffing] to generate a [Smog] attack. [Ash] counters with [Butterfree]'s [Whirlwind], and [Brock] asks [Zubat] to use [Double Team]; the two [Pokémon] turn the [Smog] back on [Team Rocket], much to their surprise. The four [Pokémon] exchange attacks, culminating in a [Supersonic] attack from [Zubat] and a [Whirlwind] from [Butterfree] that send [Team Rocket] blasting off again - without [Meowth].
[Misty] and [Seymour] had been following the [Clefairy], which makes its way out of the cave. They follow it up the mountain, where [Meowth] is waiting for them, and he demands that he be given the [Moon Stone]. [Misty] summons her [Staryu] by dropping its [[Poké] Ball] into the river. Without much trouble, [Staryu] sends [Meowth] blasting off as well. [Brock] feeds all the [Pokémon] with [Pokémon] food, made according to his own special recipe. [Seymour] tastes it and deems it "not bad"; [Ash] follows suit and finds it awful. Meanwhile, [Clefairy] and [Pikachu] are having a conversation on a nearby rock. They hop away, followed by the rest of the group. They arrive at another cave, where they find the huge core of the [Moon Stone]. [Clefairy] adds its stone to the ring at the base of the core, which completes the "circuit". All the small stones, then the large core, begin to glow blue in the moonlight. Dozens of [Clefairy] approach and begin to dance around the [Moon Stone], praying to it. [Seymour] states that humans are supposed to ride the Stone back out to the stars, but his epiphany is interrupted by the return of [Team Rocket].
[Seymour] attacks [Team Rocket] to keep them from the Stone, but he is unsuccessful and loses his glasses. [Ash] attacks with [Pikachu], while [Brock] summons [Onix]; as usual, [Jessie] and [James] call on [Ekans] and [Koffing]. [Jessie] orders a [Dig] attack, and [James] orders a [SmokeScreen]. [Ash] then summons [Pidgeotto] and orders it to [Whirlwind] the smoke away. When the smoke clears, [Team Rocket] is gone, and the [Moon Stone] with them. [Brock] orders [Onix] to [Dig] and follow [Team Rocket] underground, while the humans and other [Pokémon] run through the caves. One of the [Clefairy] retrieves [Seymour]'s glasses for him.
[Team Rocket] is sliding downhill with the Stone on a sled. [Onix] appears suddenly, upsetting the sled. [Onix] attempts to [Tackle] [Team Rocket], but [Koffing] counters, and both [Pokémon] fall to the ground. At that moment, [Seymour] and the [Clefairy] appear from [Onix]'s tunnel. The [Clefairy] use a [Metronome] attack to hypnotize the humans, and then they follow up with what appears to be a [Hyper Beam], sending [Team Rocket] flying off once more. Chips of the [Moon Stone] drift down from the sky, and as they fall on the [Clefairy], many of the [Clefairy] evolve into [Clefable]. [Seymour] stays with the [Clefairy] and [Clefable], hoping to someday visit outer space with them.
Following the night's events, [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] move on toward [Cerulean City]. [Gary] had left graffiti on a sign stating, "[Gary] was here! [Ash] is a loser!" Seeing it, [Ash] takes off down the road at a run as the episode ends.


Excited about winning his [Boulder [Badge]], [Ash] is extremely excited to get to [Cerulean City] to battle for his [Cascade [Badge]]. For some reason, though, [Misty] seems to be trying to avoid entering Cerulean, and tries, unsuccessfully, to convince the others to go to [Vermilion City] instead. She leaves [Ash] and [Brock] as they enter the city.
When [Ash] and [Brock] enter [Cerulean City], they see a big crowd of people in a circle surrounding a building. When they get to the front, they see [Officer Jenny], and she accuses [Ash] and [Brock] of being criminals. When they prove their innocence, she lets them go, and sends the rest of the crowd away. After that, they sit on a bench and [Ash] asks [Brock] for inside information on the [[Gym] Leader]. [Brock] tells him that as a [[Gym] Leader], he cannot give out that information. Then [Brock] decides to check something out that he has been meaning to look at. They split up, and [Ash] heads to the [Cerulean [Gym]] alone.
When [Ash] reaches the [Gym], he finds three sisters performing an underwater show for a crowd of people. [Ash] meets the girls backstage, finds out that they are the [[Gym] Leaders], and challenges them to a battle. The girls, [Lily], [Daisy], and [Violet], explain that their [Pokémon] are too tired to battle, and offer to give [Ash] the [Cascade [Badge]] without a proper match. [Misty], who has been spying on the entire scene, interferes at the last minute and challenges [Ash] to a battle.
As it turns out, [Misty] is herself a [Cerulean [Gym]] Leader as well, and also the youngest of [The Sensational Sisters], but because she is so much younger than her three sisters, they call her a runt and refuse to acknowledge her as being just as good as they are. After [Misty] argues with her sisters, she challenges [Ash] to an official [Cerulean [Gym]] battle, two [Pokémon] per side. [Ash] tries to send out [Pikachu], but [Pikachu] refuses to go into battle because he does not want to hurt [Misty] or her [Pokémon]. Instead, [Ash] sends out [Butterfree] to battle [[Misty]'s [Staryu]]. After a quick battle, [Butterfree] gets knocked into the water, causing him to lose the battle. After that, [Misty] sends out [Starmie] and [Ash] sends out [Pidgeotto]. [Pidgeotto] uses [Whirlwind] on [Starmie], but it jumps into the water and attacks [Pidgeotto]. [Pidgeotto] uses [Gust], causing [Starmie] to hit the wall. Just as [Ash] is about to win the battle, [Team Rocket] interrupts and tries to steal all of the [[Water]-type] [Pokémon] and the water from the [Gym] using a giant vacuum machine.
While [Team Rocket]'s vacuum is sucking up the [Water] [Pokémon], it sucks in [Pikachu] as well. He releases a [Thunderbolt] attack, which explodes the machine, sending [Team Rocket] flying. After [Team Rocket] is gone, [Daisy] gives [Ash] the [Cascade [Badge]]. [Misty] tries to argue, but her sisters convince her that if [Ash] had used [Pikachu] from the start, he would have easily beaten all of her [[Water]-type] [Pokémon]. [Misty] agrees with her sisters and claims that when she comes back from her journey with [Ash], she will be a great [Trainer]. [Brock] then meets [Ash] outside of the [Gym], and together they all head for [Vermilion City].


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are on their way to [Vermilion City]. Along the way, [Ash] has a battle with another [Trainer], and [Pidgeotto] defeats a [Rattata], securing [Ash]'s 10th victory. The [Trainer] admires [Ash]'s two [Badges], leading [Misty] to muse that giving [Ash] the [Badge] may have been a mistake. The [Trainer] points [Ash] to an unofficial [Gym], where a strong [Trainer] named [A.J.] trains "savage [Pokémon]." [A.J.] has "never lost a single match," a challenge [Ash] cannot resist.
The sign outside [A.J.]'s [Gym] indicates that he has a record of 98 wins to zero losses, but that his [Gym] is not licensed by the [[Pokémon] League]. As [Misty] insults [Ash], [A.J.] walks up and challenges [Ash] to a battle. [A.J.] snaps a whip, making [Ash] jump. He says that he plans to start competing for [Badges] after his 100th consecutive win. [Ash] smugly tells him that he has ten wins and two [[Gym] [Badges]], at which point [A.J.] insults the [Gyms], calling them "Failure City" and "Wimpsville," angering [Misty] and [Brock]. [A.J.] summons his [Sandshrew] to battle against [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]]. [Misty] reminds [Ash] that [Pikachu]'s electricity is useless against a [Ground] [Pokémon], but [Ash] rejects her advice. He summons [Pidgeotto] to battle [Sandshrew]. [Brock] notes that a [Flying] [Pokémon] should have the advantage. However, [Sandshrew] rolls itself into a ball and hurls itself into the air, striking and eliminating [Pidgeotto].
[Ash] then calls out [Butterfree]. [Ash] orders a [Stun [Spore]] attack, but [A.J.] cracks his whip and [Sandshrew] digs underground, avoiding it. It bursts out of the ground, eliminating [Butterfree] as well. Although [Ash] wants [Pikachu] to fight, [Pikachu] grabs hold of the edge of the playing field and refuses to go, finally shocking [Ash]. While all of this is happening, [Team Rocket] is spying on the match from a tree nearby. They decide they wanted to steal [A.J.]'s [Sandshrew]. Refusing to believe that anyone's [Pokémon] could be so strong, [Ash] accuses [A.J.] of cheating, as he obviously would have won in a fair fight. He demands that they have a rematch at another location, but [A.J.] tells him to quit whining. Later, [Ash] overhears [A.J.] training his [Pokémon], yelling angrily and cracking his whip. [Ash] intervenes to stop [A.J.] from hurting the [Pokémon], but [A.J.] tells him to mind his own business. His [Sandshrew] is wearing a "strength intensifier" invented by [A.J.] himself. It enables the [Sandshrew] to withstand the weakening effects of the water. [A.J.] says he's tougher on [Sandshrew] than his other [Pokémon] because it was his very first.
Appalled at [A.J.]'s training methods, [Ash] asserts that a great [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] should make friends with his [Pokémon]. He asks for [Brock]'s input, but [Brock] only wants to know what kind of food [A.J.] is using. [A.J.], like [Brock], mixes his own food to a secret recipe. [Pikachu] attempts to pick up one of [Sandshrew]'s dumbbells, but falls backward under the weight, while [Sandshrew] does rapid exercises. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is crouched behind [A.J.]'s tent, preparing for their attempted heist. After the training, [A.J.]'s [Pokémon] are all exhausted. [A.J.] insults [Pikachu], and [Ash] takes a swing at him, dumping them both into the pool. [Pikachu] tries on the strength intensifier, but it fits badly and pulls him into a ball. [Sandshrew] then makes fun of [Pikachu] and rolls itself into a ball as well.
[Team Rocket] rolls into the tent inside a rubber ball, intending to steal [Pikachu], but they grab [Sandshrew] by mistake. After [A.J.] ends the rest break, he realizes that [Sandshrew] is missing. He releases [Pikachu] from the harness, but [Pikachu] doesn't know where [Sandshrew] is either. [Ash] suggests that it ran away because it saw how much better [Ash] treated [Pikachu]. [A.J.] is extremely insulted at this, insisting [Sandshrew] would not have run away after all they had been through together. He sends his other [Pokémon] to look for [Sandshrew], but [Ash] tries to convince [A.J.]'s [Pokémon] to leave with him. Despite the way [A.J.] has treated them, they ignore [Ash]. Meanwhile, while arguing over who carries the bag, [Team Rocket] is startled when [Sandshrew] flies out. [Meowth] bites [Sandshrew]'s tail and [Sandshrew] burrows underground in pain. While [Ash] and [A.J.] are still arguing, [Sandshrew] bursts out of the ground next to him, dragging [Meowth]. Seeing how happy [A.J.] and [Sandshrew] are to be back together, [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] realize how deeply [A.J.] cares for his [Pokémon].
Realizing that he is facing a lot of angry [Pokémon] and their [Trainers], [Meowth] tries to figure a way out of his situation, when [James] and [Jessie] begin their standard litany. [Jessie] tells [A.J.] that taking his [Sandshrew] was a mistake; [James] calls it "second-rate," earning A.J's ire. He challenges them to a battle. As usual, [Jessie] summons her [Ekans] and [James] uses his [Koffing]. [Sandshrew] takes them both out, then defeats [Meowth] while the cat [Pokémon] tries to bite its armored skin. [Sandshrew] wins with a [Fissure] attack, defeating them once and for all. As this is [A.J.]'s 100th win, he and his [Pokémon] now leave to begin earning [Badges]. Like [Ash], he too wants to be the world's greatest [[Pokémon] Master]. They part as friendly rivals, agreeing to meet in the future at one of the League competitions.


As the episode begins, [Misty] and [Ash] are fighting about her broken bike again. In an effort to get them to cool off, [Brock] pulls a table and some chairs out of his backpack, with all the necessities to set it for a nice afternoon cup of tea. [Brock] sends [Ash] to collect firewood to make tea and crepes. As [Ash] and [Pikachu] wander around the forest, they encounter a group of boys in suits. One of them is running on a treadmill, while the rest are gathered around, quizzing him about various [Pokémon]. He misses a question and is rejected by the other boys, and [Ash] jumps in to defend him. The boys reveal that they are students of [[Pokémon] Technical Institute], a boarding school which educates [[Pokémon] [Trainers]]. They leave, stating they don't want to fight. As [Brock] reads from the school's brochure, [Pikachu] started the treadmill and tries to keep up. The school trains its students without sending them to collect [Badges], and guarantees entry into the [[Pokémon] League] upon graduation. [Brock] leans on the treadmill, speeding it up, which sends [Pikachu] flying. The school is expensive, and therefore populated with rich kids.
The student who was being bullied, [Joe], defends his "friends," who were trying to help him. He explains that he sometimes pretends to know less than he really does because the questions get so much harder. [Ash] is very upset at this brutal "tutoring" system, and demands to meet the student in charge, with plans to stop it. The head student of the beginner class is a girl; [Brock] and [Ash] drool over her photo, which makes [Misty] angry. [Ash] then refers to [Misty] as "someone who treats you bad and looks even worse", which makes her even angrier. [Team Rocket] reveal that they both flunked out of [[Pokémon] Tech]. Being led there by [Ash] has brought back some bad memories for [Jessie] and [James], but [Meowth] cheers them up.
[Joe] leads [Ash] and his friends to the head student [Giselle]'s study area. He says it's overall skill as a [Trainer], not any one battle, that determines success at [[Pokémon] Tech]. He says that even though he is the weakest student in his class, he is still better than someone with two [Badges]. [Misty] takes offense, and [Joe] reveals that he is familiar with her [Gym]; he usually beats her preferred [Water] [Pokémon] on the simulator. [Misty] demands a real battle, but [Joe] is doubtful of her ability to beat him. [Misty] calls her [Starmie], while [Joe] calls a [Weepinbell], a [[Grass]-type] [Pokémon] which will have an advantage over [Misty]'s [Water] type. Nevertheless, [Starmie] beats the [Weepinbell]. [Giselle] walks in and chastises [Joe] for not realizing that [Starmie]'s real battle experience would give it an advantage. She calls him an embarrassment to the school. [Giselle] continues to upbraid [Joe], and threatens to withdraw the help of the other students.
[Misty] challenges [Giselle], saying that a true friend would not walk away from a friend in need of help, and that [Giselle]'s beauty is only skin deep. [Giselle] accuses [Misty] of being jealous. [Giselle] summons a [Graveler] to challenge [[Misty]'s [Starmie]]. Although [Rock]- and [[Ground]-type] [Pokémon] are doubly weak against [Water] [Pokémon], [Giselle] and her [Graveler] defeat [Starmie] easily. [Giselle] then points out that weak [Pokémon] can still win if they are better trained. [Ash] jumps in, saying that there is more to training [Pokémon] than levels. He brags that he has two [Badges], and [Giselle] insults him. When [Ash] reveals that he has been on his quest for 2 months, she is shocked that he has not yet trained his [Pikachu] to go into a [[Poké] Ball], and snidely remarks, "Maybe your [Pokémon] are training you!"
[Ash] protests that his three [Pokémon] are his friends. [Giselle] is surprised that he had only three; most beginners have six, and she attributes his two [Badges] to luck. She is also surprised that he chose [Pikachu] as his starting [Pokémon], as they are known to be hard to handle. She is amazed at [Ash] having two [Badges], given how little he knows, and laughs at him. At this point [Pikachu] becomes angry as well, and [Ash] demands a battle. [Giselle] summons [Cubone]. [Ash] calls for a [[Thunder] Shock] attack, but [Cubone] deflects it, to his dismay. [Giselle] orders [Cubone] to use a [Leer] attack, but [Pikachu] responds by making funny faces at [Cubone]. The two [Pokémon] get into a close-range staring contest, until [Giselle] calls for a [Bone Club] attack; the bonk on the head staggers [Pikachu]. She then calls for a [Bonemerang], which knocks [Pikachu] out cold. The next time the [Bonemerang] is launched, [Pikachu] jumps over it, and twists the skull on [Cubone]'s head backwards, so it can no longer see. [Pikachu] then pummels the [Cubone], finally ducking away as the [Bonemerang] comes back to take out its master. [Giselle] is amazed that [Pikachu] has won without using electricity, and stunned that she has lost.
[Team Rocket] takes advantage of everyone's distraction to appear with their motto. The Tech students, recognizing them as bad guys who flunked out, attack [Team Rocket] en masse, causing them to flee. [Joe] decides to leave [[Pokémon] Tech] and return home to start over like [Ash] did. [Joe] asks if he can keep [Giselle]'s picture; she said she has one of him, because they are now friends. Perhaps one day they will meet in the [[Pokémon] League]. [Ash] then demands to know why he and [Misty] are not friends like [Joe] and [Giselle] are, and she responds that it is because [Joe] doesn't owe [Giselle] a bike!


[Ash] and his friends are wandering through the forest without a compass, trying to find the path to [Vermilion City]. [Ash] and [Misty] are fighting as usual, this time over who led them astray, while [Brock] tries to get them to cool down. They pause for a rest, and [Ash] sees an [Oddish] taking a drink. [Misty] sends her [Starmie] to fight the [Oddish] so she can catch it. The [Oddish] is defeated, but [Misty]'s [[Poké] Ball] is deflected by the appearance of a [Bulbasaur] before she can claim it. The [Bulbasaur] attacks and defeats [Starmie]; [Ash] sends his [Butterfree] after the [Bulbasaur] with a [[Sleep] Powder] attack, but [Bulbasaur] blows the powder back at [Butterfree]. Both the [Oddish] and the [Bulbasaur] run off into the underbrush.
The trio attempt to cross a rope bridge, but a wind starts to rip the bridge apart. [Brock] falls into the river below, while [Misty] and [Pikachu] cling to [Ash]. [Ash] ultimately manages to pull them up, and the three make their way to the end of the bridge. They make their way down to water level and go looking for [Brock]. At once, [Misty] falls into a pit trap not unlike those made by [Team Rocket]. [Ash] pulls her out, and they go on looking. As they walk along, [Misty]'s toe catches a rope, and they find themselves suspended in a net. They are found in this state by the [Bulbasaur]. [Ash] speculates that [Brock] has been washed to sea and shanghaied by pirates; moments later, [Brock] appears and frees them from the trap. [Brock] relates his experience in the river; he was rescued from the rapids by an "incredibly beautiful" girl. [Brock] takes them to a village and introduces them to the girl, [Melanie].
[Ash] and [Misty] notice the large number of [Pokémon] in the village and wonder if they belong to [Melanie]. [Brock] explains that this [Hidden Village] is a place for abandoned or injured [Pokémon] to come to rest and relax. [Melanie] cares for them until they are better, and then they leave. [Melanie] collects plants to use for medicine, though she says that she is unqualified to be a [Pokémon] doctor. [Misty] teases [Brock] for falling in love with [Melanie]; he reacts a little violently, fearing [Melanie] might overhear. [Melanie] explains that she set the traps they fell into to prevent [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] from reaching the village. She is trying to protect the injured [Pokémon] from being captured while they are too ill to escape. Meanwhile, [Jessie], [James] and [Meowth] try to cross the remains of the bridge, but it collapses under them, dumping them into the river.
[Brock] promises [Melanie] that they will not try to catch any of the [Pokémon] in the village. Despite her earlier attempt to catch [Oddish], [Misty] concurs. [Ash] worries if the traps are enough to keep robbers away, noting the idiocy of being caught in them. The camera cuts to [Team Rocket], who have just fallen into their third pit trap. They finally manage to get out, only to immediately get caught in a net. [Brock] and [Ash] tend to a [Staryu], while [Misty] apologizes to the [Oddish]. She and [Ash] begin quarreling, and the [Bulbasaur] tackles [Misty], thinking [Oddish] is in danger. [Melanie] explains that [Bulbasaur] has volunteered to protect the whole village. [Bulbasaur] tries to push [Ash] out of the village because it doesn't trust [[Pokémon] [Trainers]].
Suddenly, [Team Rocket] appears from behind a cloud, standing on a balloon-lifted platform, and recite their mantra. They land in a clearing outside the village, and try to collect all the [Pokémon] in the village with a massive vacuum. [Brock] herds everyone into the cabin, but [Oddish] gets caught in the suction. [Bulbasaur] rescues [Oddish] with its [Vine Whip], and [Ash] helps block the wind so it can carry [Oddish] to the cabin. The vacuum starts to actually pull the roof off the cabin, so [Bulbasaur] uses its vines to smack the hose around. [Ash] calls on his [Pidgeotto] with instructions to start a [Gust] attack. The resultant tornado tosses [Team Rocket] and their platform into the distance.
[Melanie] asks [Ash] to take the [Bulbasaur] with him; the village is too small for its bulb to grow. She says the [Pokémon] are staying in the village too long, because the [Bulbasaur] has done too good a job of protecting them. She feels [Ash] will be a good [Trainer] for [Bulbasaur]. [Bulbasaur] agrees to go with [Ash], on condition that they battle first. [Ash] sends [Pikachu], and the two trade rams. [Bulbasaur] uses its vine whips to toss [Pikachu] around, but [Ash] calls for a [Thunderbolt], which shocks [Bulbasaur] into submission, allowing [Ash] to catch it. [Brock] offers to stay and help, but [Melanie] refuses, telling him to continue on his adventures.


[Ash] and his friends seem to have lost their way en route to [Vermilion City], frustrating [Misty]. The group stops to consult a map that [Brock] has unfolded, and [Ash] determines that, while they are currently in the middle of nowhere, the trail they are following intersects [Route 24], which in turn leads straight to [Vermilion City]. [Brock], satisfied with how they must proceed, puts the map away. But, as they move to leave, a large shadow suddenly falls across their path, causing them to look up in alarm. Soon, however, the sunlight's intensity dims, revealing a [Charmander] sitting upon a rock. After checking his [Pokédex], [Ash] is happy that he finally has gotten a chance to catch a [Charmander]. [Brock] points out how weak its tail flame is, and that it probably needs help. However, [Charmander] resists [Ash]'s attempt to catch it. [Brock] still thinks that it is too weak because of its small flame, and suggests that [Ash] try again, but [Ash]'s second attempt yields no better results than the first. [Pikachu] then climbs up onto the rock and talks to the [Charmander]. He then comes back down and manages to communicate to [Ash] that [Charmander] is waiting for someone to come by and pick it up. [Brock] decides that if it belongs to someone else, it is best to leave it, and they leave.
Farther down the trail, [Ash] and his friends discover the [[Pokémon] Center] that is on the map, and they enter just as it begins to rain. Despite [Brock]'s concerns, [Ash] points out that there is no way the [Charmander] would have waited around that long. [Brock] agrees, stating that the [Trainer] surely would have gotten it by now. However, they hear laughter nearby, and look over to see a [Trainer] named [Damian] surrounded by a group of friends. Listening in on his conversation, [Ash] and his friends listen as [Damian] reveals that he had a [Charmander], but since it was so weak, he left it on a rock out in the middle of the woods promising to return for it, which he had and still has no intention of doing. [Ash] and his friends realize that it must have been his [Charmander] they saw and that based on [Damian]'s description of [Charmander]'s loyalty to him, it must still be waiting on the rock. This pushes the normally calm [Brock] over the edge, and he stands up and makes his way over to [Damian]. While the group continue to laugh about how the [Charmander] is probably still waiting, [Brock] confronts [Damian], telling him to go get the [Charmander]. [Damian] pushes him off, but [Ash] and [Misty] soon arrive to back up [Brock]. After [Damian] and his crew leave, [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] hurry back to find [Charmander].
The three race back through the pouring rain towards the rock where the [Charmander] is, only to find it is now having worse problems than just the weather. A gang of [Spearow] are attacking it, and [Ash] tries to drive them off by throwing a rock at them, but this only causes them to attack him and his friends. [Ash] orders a [[Thunder] Shock] from [Pikachu], and he obeys, scaring off the [Spearow]. The group quickly wrap [Charmander] up in their rain coats and race back to the [[Pokémon] Center], begging [Nurse Joy] to help. Initially, [Nurse Joy] is angry at [Ash] and his friends, but [Ash] explains that it was [Damian] that left the [Charmander] there, taking advantage of [Charmander]'s loyalty. [Brock] pleads with [Nurse Joy] to save the [Charmander], and she promises to do whatever she can. After an intense and distressing wait, [Nurse Joy] finally comes out of the operating room and reports success. The [Charmander] has pulled through, and it will be fine by morning.
When morning comes, [Ash] and [Misty] are asleep on couches in the lobby, [Pikachu] asleep below. [Ash] rolls over, causing his blanket to drop onto [Pikachu]. Suddenly, [Brock] shouts, causing [Ash] to crash off the couch. It turns out [Charmander] has disappeared from the emergency room. [Ash] is certain that the [Charmander] has simply gone back to the rock. [Brock] wants to go after it again, but [Misty] points out that it is no use. Even though [Damian] does not care about it, the [Charmander] is still loyal to him, and nothing is likely to change that. They cannot force [Charmander] to go with them if it chooses not want to. Although [Brock] is still disappointed, [Ash] and company leave as well. Meanwhile, up ahead, [Team Rocket] have just finished digging another pitfall trap for the twerps. [Pikachu] comes up to the hole and walks right over it, but [Pikachu] is too light to trigger the pitfall. [Jessie] and [James] argue over who blew it this time, until [Meowth] shuts them up with scratches to the face. [Ash], [Brock], and [Misty], being a lot heavier, end up triggering the pitfall and fall into the hole. [Team Rocket] then appear, laughing at the fact that their trap worked. [Pikachu] tries to shock them, but they are dressed in rubber uniforms that insulate against electricity. [Pikachu] tries to run, but they release a special ball that encompasses [Pikachu] and also insulates his electricity.
Laughing at the group's plight, [Team Rocket] prepare to leave with [Pikachu] in tow, when [Charmander] confronts them. [Charmander], as translated by [Meowth], orders them to give [Pikachu] back to [Ash] and the others. [Team Rocket] naturally refuse, and warn the [Charmander] to beat it or else. The [Charmander] responds by closing its eyes, focusing hard, and unleashing a massive [Flamethrower], which roasts [Team Rocket]. They drop the [Pikachu] balloon and flee. All of this is witnessed by and shocks [Damian], who had not realized [Charmander] was so powerful. [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock], having gotten out of the pit, thank [Charmander] for its help, and [Ash] asks [Charmander] if it wants to come along with them. However, [Damian] claims that he has come back for [Charmander], "just as he promised". [Damian] goes on to say that abandoning [Charmander] had made it stronger. Despite retorts from [Ash] and company, [Damian] brags about his abominable methods of treating and training [Pokémon]. When he tries to recall [Charmander] by throwing his [[Poké] Ball] at it, [Charmander] saw how cruel [Damian] was and rejects him as its trainer by throwing the ball back at him with its tail. Enraged, [Damian] attempts to attack [Charmander] with all his [[Poké] Balls], but [Charmander] uses [Flamethrower] on him, followed by [Pikachu]'s [Thunderbolt], forcing [Damian] to flee. [Charmander] happily chooses to go with [Ash] as its trainer.


The episode opens with a recap of how [Ash] caught his [Bulbasaur] and his [Charmander]. It seems that his current successful streak is making [Ash] quite confident. [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are walking down the road, when they fall into a pit. A group of [Squirtle] wearing sunglasses peer into the hole, laughing. [Ash] angrily climbs out of the hole and uses his [Pokédex] on the [Squirtle]. He orders [Pikachu] to use a [[Thunder] Shock], but one of the [Squirtle] takes the hit for the one that seems to be the leader. A battle ensues, but [Officer Jenny] soon arrives, scaring away the [Squirtle].
At the police station, Jenny explains that the group of [Squirtle] that they met earlier are called the "[[Squirtle] Squad]". They are a group of [Squirtle] that have all been abandoned by their [Trainers], and all they do is run wild and play pranks on everyone. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is accosted by the [[Squirtle] Squad], tied to a tree, and all of their food is stolen and eaten. Taking advantage of the [Squirtle]'s mistrust of humans, [Meowth] tricks them into helping him with [Team Rocket]'s latest plan to finally steal [Pikachu]. Elsewhere, [Misty] is fishing while [Ash] and [Brock] lie by the riverside. One of the [[Squirtle] Squad] members pops up and soaks them with a [[Water] Gun]. [Ash], having had enough of the [[Squirtle] Squad]'s antics, confronts the [Squirtle] when it jumps out of the water. [Pikachu] charges to attack, but the [Squirtle] withdraws into its shell and spins at him, knocking [Pikachu] into the water - at the worst possible time, too, as there is a wild [Goldeen] in the water.
[Ash] yells for [Pikachu] to swim to shore, and he starts to, but he can't outswim the [Goldeen]. [Pikachu] gets stabbed by [Goldeen]'s horn and knocked back out of the water. [Ash] runs to help his friend, but three of the [Squirtle] quickly tie him up, along with [Misty] and [Brock]. Later, the three of them are tied to a rock in a cave, with [Pikachu] in a cage nearby. [Meowth] taunts [Ash] about [Team Rocket]'s plan; [Ash] tries to appeal to the [Squirtle] not to believe [Meowth], but [Meowth] retaliates and refutes everything [Ash] says to keep the [Squirtle] on [Team Rocket]'s side. [Brock] realizes that [Pikachu] in bad shape, and that they need to heal him. [Ash] begs the [Squirtle] to let him go into town to get the medicine, and the [Squirtle] acquiesce. They release [Ash] on threat of dyeing [Misty]'s hair if he does not return in time, and he sprints to the nearest town. After being knocked out by [Gary] slamming a door into him, [Ash] wakes up to hear [Team Rocket] holding up the store. Before he can chase them down, however, he manages to obtain the medicine and gets a ride back to the cave with [Officer Jenny].
With the bridge to town broken, Jenny and [Ash] find another way into the cave, but it is too narrow for an adult, so [Ash] has to go through it alone. However, he finds that everyone is gone, and he quickly races out of the cave to find [Misty], [Brock], and [Pikachu] completely unhurt. Apparently, the [Squirtle] were bluffing earlier; they may play tricks, but they would never do anything nasty. [Pikachu] is then promptly healed. Suddenly, however, a flash bomb explosion signifies the arrival of [Team Rocket], complete with their motto. They throw down a few more flash bombs, and drop a ladder for [Meowth] to climb up with [Pikachu], whom he apparently nabbed while everyone else was distracted by the bombs. As everyone runs for cover, [Ash] looks back and sees the leader of the [[Squirtle] Squad] fallen on its back and unable to move. [Ash] quickly races back and dives on top of the [Squirtle], protecting it from the ensuing explosions. Another pair of bombs are dropped, and [Ash] tells the [Squirtle] to save itself. The [Squirtle], however, hefts [Ash] up over its head and runs for the cave, saving them both.
[Team Rocket] is jubilant with their victory, but [Ash] interrupts them. [Team Rocket] is shocked, and [Ash] orders the [Squirtle] to use [[Water] Gun]. The [[Water] Gun] blows a hole in the balloon, sending them blasting off, and [Pikachu] is saved. However, it turns out there are bigger problems: the Flash Bombs dropped by [Team Rocket] have started a fire that could burn down the whole town. Fortunately, the [[Squirtle] Squad] steps in and puts out the fire with their [[Water]-type] attacks, and the town praises them as their new firefighters. Soon, [Ash] and his friends are on their way once more, [Pikachu] back to his perky self, when [Misty] realizes that the [[Squirtle] Squad] boss is following them. [Ash] offers the [Squirtle] the opportunity to join his team, and [Squirtle] happily accepts.


While [Ash] is wandering through the forest with his friends, he begins bragging about his accomplishments, but [Misty] claims all his [Pokémon] followed him, and therefore he failed to actually catch any of them. This angers [Ash], who then runs off through the forest vowing to catch a seventh [Pokémon], but legitimately this time. As he breaks free of the forest, he finds himself on a beach, too wrapped up in his own [Pokémon] thoughts to enjoy the beautiful sunset. While he is moping, he notices a small [Krabby] scurrying between his feet. [Ash] insults [Krabby] about its small size, and it challenges him to a battle. Not even bothering to call upon one of his [Pokémon], [Ash] lunges at [Krabby] with a stick (which [Krabby] slices into pieces with little effort), throws a [[Poké] Ball], and catches it. When the [[Poké] Ball] is transferred to [Oak]'s lab, [Misty] teaches him that [Trainers] can carry a maximum of six [Pokémon] with them at one time. Suddenly, [Pikachu] begins jumping and looking at a distant object, and as the gang looks over they can make out the shape of a lighthouse on a cliff. Excited, they all run towards it.
By the time they arrive there, night has fallen and the long walk has made them exhausted. [Ash] rings the bell, only to be greeted by an eerie ringing and a mysterious voice asking them to identify themselves. After [Ash] and company explain their situation and [Brock] offers to cook the lighthouse keeper a bacon-double cheeseburger, they are granted entrance. But as the door swings open, they find there is no one there to greet them. [Ash] asks for permission to use the lighthouse's phone, and is directed to a phone near them. The owner of the voice is still unknown. [Ash] calls [Professor [Oak]] to ask about his newly caught [Krabby]. As he picks up, the professor is shown cooking dinner. [Ash] is enraged upon hearing that [Gary] has also caught a [Krabby], and becomes even more so when he sees how large it is compared to his own. [Ash] is further humiliated when he finds out that [Gary] has already caught 45 [Pokémon], dwarfing [Ash]'s mere seven. [Oak] tells them that they are calling from [[Bill]'s [Lighthouse]], and that he knows more than [Oak] himself, so listening to him would be good.
Suddenly, a giant [Kabuto] appears, claiming to be the keeper of the lighthouse. It is revealed that the [Kabuto] is in fact [Bill], who has become stuck in a [Pokémon] suit during his research. [Ash] helps him out. After receiving a life lesson from [Bill] and learning that there are more than 150 known [Pokémon] species, the friends learn from [Bill] that there is only one [Pokémon] he is searching for, which he claims is the largest [Pokémon] ever. He says it is unique and that no one had ever laid eyes on it. One night, he says, he heard a strange noise coming across the ocean from the [Pokémon], but that was the last time he heard it.
As [Bill] is reminiscing, the same sound is suddenly heard, and a large figure appears, rising from the ocean. It is revealed to be the outline of a giant [Dragonite]. As it comes closer to the lighthouse, [Team Rocket] is shown scaling the cliff and, upon seeing the giant [Dragonite], they begin launching a barrage of missiles to try to catch it. This angers [Dragonite], and it smashes the top of the lighthouse and begins to walk away. [Bill] calls out at it to stay, but to no avail.
In the morning, [Bill] seems to be at peace with the fact that he failed to learn more about the [Pokémon] and is simply grateful he got to see it at all. With another life lesson from [Bill], the heroes say goodbye and continue on their journey.


After two weeks of traveling, [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] have finally made it to [Vermilion City]. [Brock] and [Misty] are eager to get cleaned up, but [Ash] is more concerned about finding the [Vermilion [Gym]]. However, [Brock] stops [Ash], and points out that [Pikachu] is in no condition to battle. [Pikachu] and [Ash] are also very hungry. However, at the [[Pokémon] Center], [Ash] and his friends witness [[Nurse Joy]'s [Chansey]] and a [Trainer] run in. On a stretcher pushed by the [Chansey] is a badly beaten-up [Rattata]. [Brock] wonders what happened, and [Nurse Joy] sadly comments on all of the injured [Pokémon] brought in. [Ash] and his friends are then taken to a room where there are many badly injured [Pokémon], including a [Caterpie], an [Oddish], a [Sandshrew], and the previously seen [Rattata]. [Nurse Joy] explains that they have all lost to [Lt. Surge], the [Vermilion City] [[Gym] Leader]. At this, [Ash] begins to worry over his upcoming [Gym] battle against Surge.
[Misty] unhelpfully reminds [Ash] that he only received his first two [Badges] out of pity, but [Ash] retorts that a [Badge] is a [Badge]. After a heated exchange with [Misty] on the subject, a bell chimes to signal that [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]] are fully recovered. However, upon seeing the injured [Pokémon], [Pikachu] becomes frightened to take on [Lt. Surge] and flatly refuses to battle. [Ash] drags [Pikachu] with him to the [Vermilion [Gym]] anyway, and [Ash] enters the [Gym] declaring his intention to win a [[Thunder] [Badge]]. [Lt. Surge]'s two subordinates in the [Gym] mock [Pikachu], and the man himself is even crueler, christening [Ash] "baby" and [Pikachu] a "baby [Pokémon]". Surge then calls on his [Raichu], a [Pokémon] that has a personality very like its [Trainer]'s. Despite Surge's assertion that [Ash] should have evolved [Pikachu] already, [Ash] protests, claiming that there is more to a [Pokémon] battle than evolution.
Listening to Surge's taunts, [Pikachu] decides that he is ready to fight [Raichu]. [Lt. Surge] accepts [Ash]'s challenge and the battle promptly begins. Both [Pokémon] begin with a [[Thunder] Shock] attack, but [Raichu]'s is significantly stronger and does far more damage to [Pikachu] than [Pikachu] deals to [Raichu]. [Brock] realizes that [Pikachu] simply cannot stand up to [Raichu]'s more powerful attacks and recommends that [Ash] withdraw [Pikachu]. However, when [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to return, he refuses and charges again at [Raichu]. The resulting trade-off between [Pikachu] and his adversary leaves [Pikachu] severely damaged by a [Mega Punch] and [Mega Kick] from [Raichu]. Meanwhile, outside, [Team Rocket] is looking in, seeing [Pikachu] getting knocked around. They begin to worry that if [Pikachu] is getting beaten up like this, then maybe he is not worth stealing after all, and all their efforts have been in vain. [Meowth] suggests that they could steal [Raichu] instead, but [Jessie] and [James] decide that they should root for [Pikachu]. However, [Lt. Surge] and [Raichu] have already won, with [Raichu] unleashing a powerful [Thunderbolt] that defeats [Pikachu] easily.
Later, at the [[Pokémon] Center], [Pikachu] awakens, and [Ash] is relieved that he is all right. [Pikachu], however, is upset to have been beaten so badly by [Raichu]. [Nurse Joy] enters the room, revealing that she has come across a [[Thunder] Stone]. With it, [Ash] could evolve his [Pikachu] into a [Raichu] as well. [Brock] warns him to think hard about this, because once he evolves [Pikachu], there is no way to change him back. At this, [Ash] is extremely torn. He knows that if he evolves [Pikachu] into [Raichu], he might be able to defeat [Lt. Surge]. However, he also realizes that if he were to evolve [Pikachu] just to battle, he would be no better than [Lt. Surge]. Finally, he decides to let [Pikachu] choose. Outside, [Team Rocket] watch intently to see what choice [Pikachu] will make. [Pikachu] stands up and whacks away the [[Thunder] Stone] with his tail. [Pikachu] then goes into a tirade, which moves even [Meowth] to tears. [Meowth] explains that [Pikachu] doesn't want to change; he wants to battle [Lt. Surge] again, but as a [Pikachu]; he wants to win in the name of all [Pikachu] everywhere. [Ash] agrees with [Pikachu]'s decision and promises that they will win together. [Brock] suggests a strategy change, but [Ash] is convinced they can find a way. [Pikachu] says he will fight to defend both his honor and [Ash]'s. While waiting for [Pikachu] to fully recover, [Brock] believes that there might be a solution to defeat [Lt. Surge] and his [Raichu] after all when learning that [Lt. Surge] had evolved his [Raichu] the moment he caught it.
Later, [Ash] and the fully recovered [Pikachu] head back towards the [Vermilion [Gym]]. After receiving bizarre cheers from [Team Rocket], they arrive at the [Gym], ready for their rematch. Once again, it is to be [[Lt. Surge]'s [Raichu]] against [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]]. The battle begins, and [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to stick to their planned strategy. [Lt. Surge] uses the same strategy as last time, but [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to dodge [Raichu]'s heavy attacks, causing [Raichu] to give itself recoil damage from moves like [Body [Slam]]. [Ash] then orders [Pikachu] to use [Agility], and [Pikachu] accelerates to full speed. Repeated [Body [Slam]] attempts from [Raichu] all miss completely, as [Pikachu] is simply too fast. [Brock] then reveals the strategy: because [Lt. Surge] evolved his [Pikachu] into a [Raichu] too fast, it never had a chance to learn the speed attacks it can only learn in [Pikachu] form. [Lt. Surge], growing aggravated, orders [Raichu] to fill the entire [Gym] with a vicious [Thunderbolt] attack. [Raichu] rips up the arena floor and even blows out all the windows around the arena. At first, [Lt. Surge] is convinced he has won, but the smoke clears, revealing the unharmed [Pikachu] standing on his tail.
[Brock] explains that [Pikachu] used his tail as a ground to dodge the electric shocks. [Lt. Surge] orders another [Thunderbolt], but [Raichu] is unable to muster up the electricity for it. [Ash] orders a [Quick Attack], to which [Lt. Surge] responded by ordering a [Take Down]. The quicker [Pikachu] manages to strike first, slamming into [Raichu]'s stomach. He then slams into [Raichu] while surrounding himself with electricity, knocking out his opponent and winning the match. Conceding defeat, [Lt. Surge] awards [Ash] with the [[Thunder] [Badge]]. He no longer refers to [Ash] as "baby", and [Raichu] even shows kindness and respect for [Pikachu] as well. As [Ash] and [Pikachu] share an electrifying hug, [Team Rocket] walk off, with [James] realizing that they had spent the episode helping [Ash] and his friends.


After earning the [[Thunder] [Badge]], [Ash] and his friends walk across a bridge and spot a luxury liner in the distance. The group take a closer look at the ship and they want to get on board, but [Brock] mentions that they cannot afford it, so they walk away sullen. However, [Jessie] and [James], in disguise as ganguro girls, give them tickets to get on board to participate in a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] party on board the [St. Anne]. While [Ash] and his friends look for the luxury liner, [Jessie] and [James] head to a nearby lighthouse to meet up with [Meowth]. [Meowth] opens up a call with the boss and [Meowth] notices a [Persian] hugging up to the boss; it has replaced [Meowth] due to the group's constant failure. [Team Rocket] reveal their plan: the party is a ruse to allow [Team Rocket] to steal the attending [Trainers]' [Pokémon].
[Ash] and his friends board the ship and head into the main ballroom, noticing all the people, [Pokémon], and merchandise. [Ash] notices a battle between a [Starmie] and a [Raticate]. [Raticate] uses [Super Fang] to break [Starmie]'s jewel, giving [Raticate] the win. [Ash] decides to step forward to challenge the [[Raticate]'s [Trainer]], sending [Butterfree] out. [Raticate] attacks with [Jump Kick], but [Butterfree] counters with [Tackle]. [Raticate] uses [Hyper Fang], but [Butterfree] uses [Stun [Spore]] to paralyze it. [Ash] prepares to finish the duel, but the [Gentleman] recalls his [Raticate] and declares it a draw, even though [Ash] was actually winning. Meanwhile, [James] walks by the vendors. A salesman calls him over and convinces him to buy a [Magikarp], tricking him into thinking that the [Pokémon] is worth a lot of money.
The ship sails out of [Vermilion City] as [Ash] and his friends chow down. The [Gentleman] comes up to [Ash] and commends his [Butterfree]. He proposes a trade between his [Raticate] and [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]]. [Ash] asks [Brock] if he should go through with it, but [Brock] is too attracted to the woman next to him to respond, so [Ash] agrees to go ahead with the trade. They go to a trade machine and execute the trade; [Ash] acquires [Raticate] while the man gets [Butterfree]. Meanwhile, [Jessie] and [Meowth] are extremely displeased at [James]'s being conned into buying a worthless [Pokémon] such as [Magikarp]. [Misty] finds [Ash] looking out at sea, having second thoughts about the trade, and unsure if [Butterfree] will be well taken care of. He mentions that, as the trade was happening, he remembered the experiences he had shared with [Butterfree].
[Team Rocket]'s plan goes into motion, the ballroom being locked down and [[[Team Rocket] Grunts]] confronting the [Trainers]. The grunts use vacuums to capture the [Trainers]' [[Poké] Balls]. When one of the grunts walks up to [Ash] and demands his [Pokémon], [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to attack the thugs with [ThunderShock]. He spurs the other [Trainers] to fight back, and everyone sends out their [Pokémon]. [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]], [Charmander], and [Bulbasaur], together with [[Brock]'s [Geodude]], join the other [Pokémon] in stopping the [Team Rocket] thugs. [Ash] notices a [Butterfree] swarm attacking with [Stun [Spore]] and decides to summon his [Butterfree]. However, the [[Poké] Ball] reveals his [Raticate] as [Misty] reminds him that he traded [Butterfree] away. As he watches, [Ash] deeply misses his [Butterfree], remembering his experiences with it and wanting it back.
[Ash] sends out [Pidgeotto] to join others in a group [Gust] attack. [Pikachu] group uses [Thunderbolt] to send [Team Rocket] flying off the ship and foiling the attack. However, during the battle the ship has sailed directly into a storm. Strong waves begin to batter the ship. [James] drops the [[Poké] Ball] holding [Magikarp], and runs after it. Meanwhile, [Ash] finds the [Gentleman], and requests that the trade be reversed. The man agrees, and they begin to execute a reverse trade. The captain tries to calm the passengers, assuring them that the ship is unsinkable, but, after another wave crashes against the ship, he goes down in a lifeboat. The passengers quickly begin scrambling onto the other lifeboats to evacuate. [Misty] and [Brock] find [Ash] finishing the trade. [Ash] grabs his [[Poké] Ball], but another wave causes him to drop it. [Ash] runs after it as his friends follow.
By this time, most of the passengers have gotten safely off the ship. As [Ash] grabs [Butterfree]'s [[Poké] Ball], the ship rocks again, throwing him and his friends into another room, and knocking them out. Likewise, just as [James] grabs [Magikarp]'s [[Poké] Ball], another wave sends [Team Rocket] flying against a wall; they too are knocked unconscious. The ship capsizes, and goes down. The captain, watching from his life boat, assumes that everyone is safe, not realizing that [Ash], his friends, and [Team Rocket] are still on board.


At the end of the previous episode, the [St. Anne] overturned and sank into the sea, taking [Ash], his friends, and [Team Rocket] down as well. The next morning, a police ship pulls up at the location. [Officer Jenny] gives a short speech to commemorate the missing characters, presumed dead. She tosses a bouquet of white flowers into the sea of debris as a memorial. Jenny and the other officers salute, and one plays the trumpet as the flowers sink underwater. Meanwhile, [Misty], [Brock], and [Pikachu] call to [Ash] to wake him up. [Misty] points to the porthole and [Ash] looks out, noticing fish swimming. He realizes that the ship has sunk, the image panning out and showing the ship upside down atop a seamount, positioned at the mouth of a trench.
Meanwhile, [Jessie] and [James] wake up from being knocked out as well. They run out into the hall and notice everything upside down. [Meowth] informs them that the ship capsized and sank. [James] panics as [Jessie] brings out [Ekans]. She orders it to use [Acid] to open a hole in the floor. [Meowth] tries to stop her, but is too late. The attack opens a hole, through which water begins to shoot as the ship rumbles. [Jessie] and [James] try to block the jet of water, but fail, as the water fills the hall and washes [Team Rocket] away. Elsewhere on the ship, [Ash] and his friends head out into the stairwell, the water level preventing them from going to the deck. [Misty] notes that the ship will take time to fill with water, but time is still critical. [Ash] wants to dive down to the deck, but [Brock] says that it could be dangerous. [Ash] realizes he is right, as he has a vision of running into a locked hatch and drowning. [Misty] sends out her [Goldeen] to scout the hall. It swims down and finds a dead end, but runs into the members of [Team Rocket], who are again unconscious.
As [Ash] and his friends wait for [Goldeen], [James]'s head pops out of the surface, scaring them. [Goldeen] then comes into view as it pushes [Team Rocket], who are blue in the face from nearly drowning, up onto the deck. [Jessie] and [James] regain consciousness and stand up, ready to battle. They send out [Ekans] and [Koffing] as [Ash] and [Brock] send out [Charmander], [Squirtle], [Bulbasaur], and [Geodude]. Before any of them can launch an attack, the ship begins to tip, sending everyone sliding. [Ash] orders the [Pokémon] to go to the other side, but they cause the ship to tilt the other way. After sliding back and forth, [Misty] orders everyone to recall their [Pokémon] and forget the battle in order to survive. They do so and the ship regains balance. [Misty] finally manages to convince everyone to work together temporarily. With the truce, [Misty] reveals that she knows the ship blueprints, because she once built a model of it, and that they should go up to the bottom of the ship and cut through the hull to escape. They approach a staircase, and [Brock] sends out [Onix] to allow everyone to climb up.
The ship's lights begin to fail as the group approaches a darkened portion of the hall. [Ash] brings out [Charmander] to light the way. They enter the next room and find it impossible to cross over to the engine room hatch due to the large gap and the raging fire below them. [Ash] has [Pikachu] shock him to get him to think. He then sends out [Bulbasaur] to use [Vine Whip] to create a bridge to the opposite hatch. [Ash] and his friends begin to slowly cross the vines, but [James] is too scared to cross, begging [Jessie] and [Meowth] to go on and leave him behind. [Jessie] slaps him and helps him regain his composure, but [Ash] and his friends are already across. [Jessie] orders [Bulbasaur] to send back the vines. Eventually, everyone makes it safely to the engine room, though [Team Rocket] is virtually exhausted. [Ash] brings out [Charmander] to use [Flamethrower] to cut an opening through the hull. [Misty] instructs everyone to strap onto a [[Water]-type] [Pokémon], but [Team Rocket] doesn't have one. The hull opens and water pours in. [Ash] recalls [Charmander], who is running from the water. [Ash] and [Pikachu] strap onto [Squirtle] while [Misty] gets [Goldeen] and [Brock] gets [Starmie]. While [Ash] and his friends swim into the waterfall and escape to the surface, [Team Rocket] is still stranded. [James] suddenly starts snickering, as he reveals the golden [[Poké] Ball] holding his [Magikarp], which has proved useful after all. [Team Rocket] straps onto [Magikarp] and attempt to escape, but they find that [Magikarp] can't swim. The water picks up and washes the ship into the trench, leaving [Team Rocket]'s fate unknown.
[Ash] and friends climb onto a makeshift platform, noticing [Team Rocket] hasn't yet made it to the surface. [Ash] looks out to sea and is unable to spot any land. [Brock] brings up the story of [Noah], sending out a bird to search for land and [Ash] does the same thing by sending [Pidgeotto] out to scout. [Pidgeotto] flies out and finds [Team Rocket] on the surface, still attached to the splashing [Magikarp]. [Pidgeotto] brings them back to the platform, and [Ash] and his friends presume that they have passed on. They attempt to push them back into the sea as a traditional burial, but [Jessie] and [James] wake up just in time to prevent their accidental drowning.
The two groups have no choice but to stay on the platform for the night. They wake up the next day and all are starving. Everyone immediately thinks of the [Magikarp] as their first source of food, [Meowth] attempts to bite it but ends up breaking his fangs, as [Magikarp] is, according to [Misty], only scales and bones. At this point, [James] is so frustrated with his [Pokémon] that he kicks it into the ocean. The [Magikarp] begins to glow as it evolves into a [Gyarados]. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] as [James] attempts to reclaim his role as the [Pokémon]'s master, but is too scared of it. [Misty] sends out [Goldeen], [Staryu] and [Starmie]. [Brock] thinks she will battle it, but she only plans to run away, with the [Water] [Pokémon] pulling the platform as everyone else attempts to row. [Gyarados] begins to pursue them, but suddenly stops. They think it is tired, but [Misty] remembers Sailor stories about [Gyarados]'s [Dragon [Rage]] attack. The waves pick up as more [Gyarados] appear. They swim in a circle, forming a powerful water cyclone. The [Gyarados] advance towards the raft. [Brock] urges everyone to flee again, but [Misty] says that nobody has ever survived the attack before. The attack sends everyone spiraling into the cyclone. [Ash] and his friends try to hold together, but they lose grip and spiral out of control.


After the attack caused by a group of [Gyarados], [Ash] and his friends end up on an island where they realize that four of [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]], including [Pikachu], are missing. On another side of the island, [Jessie] and [James] awaken to find their [Pokémon], including [Meowth], are missing. They try to call for help in a phone booth, but they soon remember they don't have any money. On another part of the island, a separated [Pikachu] finds the [[Poké] Balls] of the separated [Pokémon] and releases [Bulbasaur], [Charmander] and [Squirtle]. They then see a [Slowpoke] fishing in the sea with its tail. [Pikachu] and [Charmander] decide to ask for help but with little result while [Bulbasaur] and [Squirtle] relax on the beach.
While trying to find [Ash] and the others, [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]] are found by [Team Rocket]'s [Pokémon], [Koffing], [Ekans] and [Meowth]. [Meowth] tells [Koffing] and [Ekans] to attack [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]], only to find out they won't battle for him because he is not their master. They also tell him that they are not bad guys and only take bad orders from their masters, much to [Meowth]'s dismay, leaving him unable to battle [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]]. Each side tells the other about their missing [Trainers] and [Koffing] and [Ekans] get visibly upset when [Bulbasaur] mentions that their [Trainers] may have abandoned them. [Pikachu] immediately refutes the very idea, telling [Bulbasaur] that [Ash] would never do something like that. The two sets of [Pokémon] join together to find their [Trainers]. Meanwhile, [Meowth] is tied up for what he has done to [Pikachu] and the others in the past. While they are eating, a giant [Rhydon] frightens them. The [Pokémon] escape, accidentally leaving [Meowth] tied up. [Pikachu] unties [Meowth] so he can escape. [Meowth] shows no gratitude for [Pikachu]'s action, instead pushing him and saying that he could have got out himself. At the same time, [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] are being chased by a giant [Zapdos]. They soon elude it and decide to rest for the night. [Ash] vows to find his [Pokémon] no matter what. Meanwhile, [Jessie] and [James] are being chased by a huge [Moltres]. They run into a sign and are both knocked out, causing them to escape the [Moltres].
The next day, [Team Rocket] runs back to the phone booth and [Jessie] makes a phone call. When [James] tells her that they don't have money, she says they are calling the boss by collect. They annoy him with their motto, causing him to hang up on them. [Jessie] and [James] then use a wire to get help by pulling on it while inside, hoping it will lead to the phone company. They see a [Pikachu] and decide to catch it, not realizing until it is too late that it is in fact a giant [Pikachu]. At the same time, [Ash] and company run behind a rock after being attacked by a giant [Charizard]. Meanwhile, the [Pokémon], still searching for [Ash] and [Team Rocket], come across a giant [Blastoise]. [Squirtle] is forced to ask it for directions by the other [Pokémon], something that it's not too happy to do. [Squirtle] tries to start up a conversation with the giant [Blastoise] but it gets attacked by its [Hydro Pump]. They then see a [Venusaur] and [Squirtle] this time asks [Bulbasaur] to seek help from it as [Squirtle] thinks it's one of [Bulbasaur]'s relatives. [Bulbasaur] is too afraid to ask the giant [Venusaur] and so says that it's an orphan and has no family, to which [Squirtle] decides to call it a "coward." [Team Rocket], still pulling the telephone wire, are now being chased by a huge [Kabutops]. They decide to jump into a rail cart to get away. It starts moving but begins to head backwards toward the [Kabutops], rather than away from it. It gets its foot tied in the wire and is dragged after [Team Rocket]. Then [Ash] and friends find the giant [Pikachu], which is then knocked down because of [Team Rocket] and the trailing wire on the rail cart. [Ash] and friends fall into the cart with [Team Rocket] inside. Then they see their [Pokémon] chased by a giant [Charizard], [Blastoise] and [Venusaur]. The [Pokémon] manage to jump to their [Trainers] and are at last reunited. Then the cart is sent flying into the air because of a giant loop in the rail tracks causing them to fly and crash into the giant [Zapdos] which they then discover to be robotic. Soon all the other giant robot [Pokémon] crash into each other and lie broken in a massive pile on the beach. Then the rail cart crashes into the water. A [Gyarados] shaped boat approaches the island. Inside, a woman introduces what appears to be tourists on the boat to [Pokémon] Island, however on noticing the damaged [Pokémon], apologizes and then makes a call. It is revealed that the island is actually an attraction park owned by [Team Rocket]'s boss, [Giovanni], who isn't too happy with the destruction of [Pokémon] Land.
[Ash] and his friends continue on, ending up in [[Porta] Vista]. Meanwhile, the [Slowpoke] from earlier in the episode is still sitting on the rocks. It stands up, revealing a [Shellder] attached to its tail. The newly evolved [Slowbro] looks forward and says its name proudly.


[Ash] and his friends have finally arrived in [[Porta] Vista], a beachside tourist town. Wasting no time, [Ash], [Brock] and [Pikachu] change into swimsuits and jump into the ocean. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket], still using their [Gyarados] submarine, spy on beachgoers from their vantage point underwater. They decide to steal the money of the wealthy tourists. Suddenly, [Jessie] notices a speeding boat heading in their direction. The boat is piloted by [Ash], who thought [Brock] borrowed it because [Pikachu] was on the boat. The boat collides with the sub and eventually crashes into a dock. [Moe], the owner of the boat, comes out to survey the damage. [Ash], [Brock] and [Misty] volunteer to work to help pay the cost of repairing the boat and the dock. [Moe] agrees to this.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket]'s submarine has washed up onto a private beach and they're greeted by a woman named [Brutella]. [James] asks if they can work for her restaurant to help pay for repairs to their sub, and she agrees. Later, it's revealed that both [Moe] and [Brutella] are restaurateurs and rivals. For a while, [Brutella]'s restaurant has more customers and [Team Rocket] taunts [Ash] and his friends over this. [Ash] decides to have his [Pokémon] help out as well. [Squirtle] and [Pikachu] are told to hand out fliers advertising [Moe]'s; [Pidgeotto] and [Charmander] are to help keep the grill going in the kitchen, and [Bulbasaur] is assigned to help [Misty] do her waitress duties. This works well until [Meowth] sabotages everything - sending fliers flying, spraying oil on the stove, and throwing banana peels on the floor to trip up [Misty] and [Bulbasaur]) - causing the crowd to leave [Moe]'s restaurant for [Brutella]'s. [Ash] apologizes for messing everything up.
[Brutella] arrives with [Team Rocket] a few minutes later and tells [Moe] that he needs to pay her the money he owes her. If he is unable to pay by the next day, she will take his boat as payment. [Moe] is despondent, as he does not think he will have the money by then. He explains that he had planned to take a world cruise in his boat. [Ash] then fervently encourages him not to give up on his dream. Then, two familiar faces appear: [Professor [Oak]] and [Ash]'s mother, [[Delia] [Ketchum]]. [Ash] is surprised to see both of them. [Professor [Oak]] explains that the [Beach Beauty and [Pokémon] Costume Contest] is set to start shortly, and he suggests handing out fliers to the audience. He also suggests that [Misty] enter and (hopefully) win some prize money to help out [Moe]. [Ash] sends out [Pidgeotto], who blankets the beach and town with fliers. Soon, [Moe]'s restaurant is full again, much to [Brutella]'s dismay.
As the contest begins, [Moe] sits with [Delia] and [Professor [Oak]]. He explains how [Ash] encouraged him not to give up on his dream. [Delia] says that she and the professor are in town with the [Pallet Town] Volunteer Patrol. The contest begins, with [Brock] as the announcer. [Misty] is the first contestant, and she uses her [Starmie] and [[Ash]'s [Squirtle]] to form a [UFO]. [Team Rocket]'s [Ekans] and [Koffing] are next, and they're costumed as an [Omastar]. They are kicked off of the stage by [[Gary] [Oak]] and his cheerleaders, who are apparently the next contestants. [Gary] grabs the microphone from [Brock] and insults [Ash], who jumps out of his seat and heads for the stage. Meanwhile, [Brutella] tells [Jessie] and [James] that she knows they are [Team Rocket] members and that she has fixed their submarine. She blackmails them into stopping the contest and destroying [Moe]'s restaurant so that the audience will come to her restaurant instead. [Jessie] tells [Brutella] that they can destroy things without even trying.
Back onstage, [Ash] challenges the always-cocky [Gary] to a battle, but [Gary] refuses, stating that he does not want to battle an amateur [Trainer]. [Brock] steps between the two rivals before [Ash]'s anger gets the best of him. Just then, the [Gyarados] submarine explodes from the water, causing panic. People run away, thinking that it is a real [Gyarados] on a rampage. [Ash] grabs the microphone and tells the remaining frightened audience members that it is a mecha, not a [Pokémon]. [Team Rocket] then fires a heat-seeking missile from the sub. Under [Gary]'s skeptical eye, [Ash] sends out [Pidgeotto] and [Charmander]. [Charmander]'s [Flamethrower] attack hits the missile, which turns and changes course: straight for the submarine! [Team Rocket] pedal furiously to get away, but they crash into [Brutella]'s restaurant, which is then destroyed by the missile.
[Ash] and his friends say farewell to [Moe], who is heading off on his long-awaited cruise. [Ash] also says goodbye to [Professor [Oak]] and his mother, who is holding a trophy inscribed with the words: "First Place in Our Hearts: [[Ash] [Ketchum]]."


[Misty] spots an injured [Horsea] in the water as she, [Ash], and [Brock] wait for the next boat to the mainland. The [Horsea] seems to be communicating a warning, painting an image with its ink, but [Misty] doesn't understand it and tries to catch it. Before she catches the [Horsea], however, there's an explosion and a boat is destroyed. [Misty] immediately sends her [[Water]-type] [Pokémon] - [Staryu], [Starmie], and [Goldeen] - to rescue the sailors that have been flung into the ocean. [Brock] grabs a nearby boat and heads out to assist in the rescue effort. The sailors are paralyzed and mumble about what caused their ship to explode.
Later, [Ash] and his friends meet [Nastina], who is the spitting image of [Brutella] from the previous episode. She explains her plans of building an exclusive hotel on the ocean (literally, perched on a coral reef) for wealthy tourists. However, her building plans are upsetting the local [Tentacool] and [Tentacruel], who've been attacking her construction site. She wants the [Pokémon] exterminated and offers a million dollar reward, which [Ash] and [Brock] are eager to accept. [Misty] angrily rejects [Nastina]'s offer. She then explains her love of [Water] [Pokémon] to [Ash] and [Brock], who don't quite understand her. [Nastina] then makes a public announcement offering the million dollars to anyone who exterminates the [Tentacool] and [Tentacruel]. The gang are nearly run over by the town's citizens, rushing to the beach to carry out [Nastina]'s orders.
[Team Rocket], who are always nearby, offer to help [Nastina]. They plan on using their "Super Secret Stun Sauce" on the [Pokémon] and then selling them at a fish market for more money. However, their boat is soon surrounded by thousands of angry [Tentacool], one of whom blasts the stun sauce with a ray gun-type attack and destroys the boat. The sauce lands on that same [Tentacool], but instead of being stunned, it evolves into a [Tentacruel] hundreds of times the normal size of the breed, and promptly begins a citywide rampage. [Meowth] is captured by the large [Tentacruel] and is used as its mouthpiece. It explains that it's destroying the city in much the same way [Nastina] has been destroying its home in the coral reef. The [Horsea] that [Misty] saw earlier pleads with the [Tentacruel] to stop, but is swatted away by a tentacle. [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] thus send out their [Pokémon] to stop the [Tentacruel].
The [Tentacruel] doesn't understand why the [Pokémon] would fight on the side of the humans, but then [Misty] stops it in its tracks. She's managed to get to the roof of a building and pleads with it to stop its rampage. She tells the [Tentacruel] that the humans now understand that what they were doing was wrong, and that the hotel won't be built on the coral reef. [Tentacruel] replies that if their homes are attacked again they will not stop the destruction, then tosses [Meowth] into a Ferris Wheel in the previously destroyed amusement park, which then collapses and causes [Meowth] to reawaken. [Tentacruel] then slowly goes into the ocean, followed by the [Tentacool]. [Nastina] attempts once again to destroy the [Tentacruel], but has her face blotched by [Horsea]'s ink before being whacked into the air by the [Tentacruel]'s tentacle. As [Brutella] from the previous episode rebuilds her restaurant, [Nastina] crash-lands into her, re-destroying the restaurant in the process.
[Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] finally board a boat to the mainland. The [Horsea] decides to be a new member of [Misty]'s team and so, [Misty] catches it. While the adventure doesn't diminish [Misty]'s love of [Tentacool], she declares that "[Horsea]'s the cutest [Pokémon] of all!" and does [Ash]'s victory pose, which annoys him. The sun sets on [Team Rocket] in a bucket attached to the ship, wearily plotting for next time.


In the beginning of the episode, [Ash] and his friends are traveling by a ferry from the holiday resort of [[Porta] Vista] to [Maiden's Peak]. After docking, they find out that they have just arrived there at the time of the annual [Summer Festival]. When they decide to go and enjoy it, [Brock] sees a beautiful girl up on the distant cliff. He immediately falls in love with her, but after being run over by a group of tourists he notices that the girl has disappeared. [Pikachu] is the only one that seems to notice that the girl is actually a [Gastly], but [Ash] and [Misty] don't seem to notice her at all.
As usual, [Team Rocket] follows [Ash] and company to [Maiden's Peak]. They come up with an idea to look around for dropped coins, and while pondering it, [James] sees the same girl [Brock] saw before, only by the water. [Jessie] slaps [James] to regain his attention. As they leave to look for the coins, [James] takes a final look at the dock, noticing the disappearance of the girl. During the festival, [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] meet an old lady. She warns [Brock] that he should beware a young, beautiful girl who will lead him to a cruel fate. After the old lady calls [Misty] a "scrawny blabbermouth", [Misty] decides that they should be somewhere else instead of being insulted and drags off [Ash] and [Brock] with her. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] puts their plan into action, though they do not seem to find anything. Then, [James] notices a penny lying on the walkway, but as he approaches it he is interrupted by the old lady, which [Ash] and company met just a moment ago. As in the case of [Brock], she mentions the young girl to [James]. Then an [Officer Jenny] appears and takes away the coin [James] found. When she suggests that they go down to the station with her to fill out a report, [Team Rocket] stammers that it is all right, they do not need to go down to the station, and then they flee the scene.
Both [Ash]'s group and [Team Rocket] head for the Shrine of the Maiden. They see the shrine's greatest treasure, the painting of the maiden. [Brock] and [James] both realize that the girl in the painting is the same girl they saw before, and both attempt to approach the painting but are blocked by the man presenting the painting to the audience. He then tells the story of the maiden, who waited on the cliff for her loved one to return from the war, and eventually turning into stone. The two groups go to take a closer look at the aforementioned cliff, and [Meowth] formulates a plan to steal the painting with the intention of selling it for a lot of money. They decide to swipe the painting later that evening. As night falls, [Brock] is still at the cliff. [Misty] tries to make him forget the stone so they can go back and enjoy the festival, but [Brock] insists on staying a little bit longer, so [Ash] and [Misty] leave him sitting there. When it is about time for the local [[Pokémon] Center] to lock the doors for the night, [Brock] still has not returned from the cliff, unlike they had planned. [Ash] decides to go look for [Brock], but [Nurse Joy] holds him back, giving [Ash] a short lecture on the importance of sleep.
In the middle of the night, [Meowth] tries to wake up [Jessie] and [James] so they can try to steal the painting, but the two are not very eager to wake up. Suddenly a strong wind starts blowing, and the doors of the Maiden's Shrine are blown open. The ghost of the maiden floats out from the inside, causes [Meowth] to fall asleep and then wakes up [James]. She also shows herself to [Brock], telling him that she's been waiting for him. [Brock] replies that he has been waiting, too. [Ash] and [Misty] start looking for [Brock] on the next morning, while [Meowth] and [Jessie] start looking for [James]. [Ash] and [Jessie] then meet face-to-face and notice that they both are looking for a missing person. [Jessie] performs the [Team Rocket] motto all alone, but then they hear [James] saying his lines. [James] is thrown from inside the shrine, followed by [Brock]. As they all try to return [Brock] and [James] normal, the old lady appears again, reminding them of her warning about the ghost of the maiden. [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] shocks [James] and [Brock], and the two of them finally revert to their normal selves. They all head inside, and the old lady states that all young men have fallen into the curse while passing through [Maiden's Peak]. They decide to protect themselves from the ghost by buying a large quantity of anti-ghost stickers and sticking them around the shrine and the two cursed ones. However, when night comes, they note that the stickers do not work, and just like the previous night, the ghost of the maiden appears. [Ash] and others try to prevent [Brock] and [James] from being pulled out by the maiden.
After being shot with a bazooka by [Jessie], the ghost of the maiden summons several skull-like ghostly apparitions. [Ash] tries to identify them with his [Pokédex], but with no results. However, the [Pokédex] is still searching for one and when [Ash] points the [Pokédex] at the ghost of the maiden, it identifies her as a [Gastly], who is impersonating the old lady as well. Since [Gastly]'s disguise has been revealed, it transforms back to its normal form. [Ash] then challenges it to a battle. [Ash] commands [Pikachu] to start the battle, but [Gastly] summons a living mouse trap to scare [Pikachu] off. [Meowth] states that mouse traps do not work on him, but [Gastly] summons a ball for him to play with, distracting him. [Jessie] then sends out [Ekans], only for it to be scared off by [Gastly]'s newly summoned mongoose. [James] commands his [Koffing] to attack with the [Poison Gas] attack, but the mongoose stomps it down.
[Ash] decides that it is his turn to try again and calls out [Charmander]. [Gastly] summons a fire extinguisher, and [Ash] has to call [Charmander] back, mainly because [Charmander] was too busy running from the water to battle. He then calls out both [Squirtle] and [Bulbasaur], but [Gastly] summons a [Venusaur] and a [Blastoise], which causes [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]] to become too scared to do anything, and just because it thinks it is fun, it combines them into a hybrid called "Venustoise". After repeatedly being beaten by [Gastly], [Misty] tries another strategy. She uses a cross, garlic, a stake, and a hammer, comparing [Gastly] to a vampire. However, the sun starts to rise once again, and as [Gastly] hates sunlight, it disappears, saying that the ghost of the maiden and the old woman will return come next year's festival. On the following night, the festival continues on. [Ash] and his friends have fun, and everything is back to normal. As the episode ends, the true ghost of the maiden emerges from her stone self, thanking [Gastly] for keeping her legend alive in the town.


On the way to [Saffron City], [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] arrive at a high cliff. [Brock] informs the others that the ridge of the cliff should lead right to [Saffron City]. Then [Ash] notices a large group of [Butterfree] in the horizon. [Brock] states that the [Butterfree] are celebrating their season of love to find a mate.
The group rents a hot-air balloon and are soon in the air following the [Butterfree]. [Ash] sends his [Butterfree] to find a mate but he struggles to get any interest from the other [Butterfree]. [Brock] states that none of the [Butterfree] may be "its type", pointing out the unique differences among all [Butterfree]. They then notice that other [Trainers] brought their [Butterfree], especially a girl [Brock] falls in love with. [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] flies back to [Ash] and friends, and after they cheer up the [Butterfree] he returns to seeking a lifetime mate. Very soon [Butterfree] falls in love with a pink [Butterfree]. The pink [Butterfree], however, rejects [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]]'s proposal. [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] keeps on trying, but the pink one eventually slaps him across the face with her wing. Being shot down, [Ash]'s teary-eyed [Butterfree] then flies away into a forest.
Eventually [Ash], [Misty], [Pikachu] and [Brock] find [Butterfree] in the forest. Totally surprised, they discuss how they could help [Butterfree]. [Ash] decides to check if the [Pokédex] could help, but [Misty] notes that "[Dexter]'s never been in love," so they instead decide to go with a show-off strategy. [Ash] tells his [Butterfree] to show his strength to win the love of the pink [Butterfree]. In order to make [Butterfree] also look better, [Brock] puts a scarf around his neck.
They return to the air with [Butterfree]. After failing to impress the pink [Butterfree] with [Whirlwind] and [Tackle], [Team Rocket] arrives in a helicopter. They sing their motto as usual and then go after the [Butterfree] using a net to gather them. [Ash] and friends try to make [Team Rocket] change their mind, but it fails. Soon all the [Butterfree] are captured by [Team Rocket], save [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]]. [Butterfree] then tries to break into the helicopter by using his [Tackle] attack on the glass, but it fails. He also tries to stop them with [Stun [Spore]], but it fails as well. [Ash] is about to recall [Butterfree] and use [Pidgeotto] instead, but [Misty] prevents this because [Ash] could hurt [Butterfree]'s feelings. [Team Rocket] leaves the scene and [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] rushes after them. [Ash] and friends follow him to a warehouse in the middle of a bare canyon.
[Ash] and friends break in through a window while [Team Rocket] reviews their catch. They improvise a mock-up version of their motto. [Team Rocket] tries to prevent them from winning, but [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] dashes through them. [Misty] calls her [Starmie] out of its [[Poké] Ball] and commands it to chase [Team Rocket] with a [Tackle] attack. Meanwhile, [Butterfree] begins to [Tackle] the net bag holding the other [Butterfree]. After repeated attempts, [Butterfree] manages to break open the bag. [Jessie] hits [Starmie] with a hammer, but [Misty] revives it by spraying water on it. [Brock] opens the doors and the [Butterfree] fly out of the warehouse. [Team Rocket] tries desperately to catch the fleeing [Butterfree] with small nets, though they fail. [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]], exhausted from breaking the net, is still inside, the pink [Butterfree] approaching him, impressed by his determination. [James] tries to catch her, but [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] knocks [James] away, also making the pink [Butterfree] blush.
[Team Rocket] attempts to steal the [Butterfree] again by getting back in the air with their helicopter. [Ash] and his friends follow them with their rented balloon and they soon find them. As the pink [Butterfree] watches, [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] flies towards [Team Rocket]'s helicopter with [Pikachu] on his back. [Pikachu] jumps on the helicopter and destroys the helicopter with his [ThunderShock] attack, sending [Team Rocket] down into the darkness. Having witnessed the determination of [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]], the pink [Butterfree] shows her new love by making her own proposal dance. Naturally, [[Ash]'s [Butterfree]] joins the dance.
Back at the cliff, [Ash], filled with emotions, bids farewell to the [Butterfree] couple. As they fly into the sunset, a flashback of [Ash]'s memories is shown. [Ash] remembers first capturing [Caterpie], then him evolving into a [Metapod] and finally into [Butterfree]. He remembers times with [Butterfree] such as battling [[Misty]'s [Staryu]] for the [Cascade [Badge]]. As [Misty] tells [Ash] [Butterfree] is nearly out of sight, he wishes [Butterfree] good luck. Everyone watches the sun set as another adventure ends.


The scene opens focusing on a silhouette of a woman, holding a visible little girl. In the woman's eyes, she sees [Ash] and his friends making their way towards [Saffron City]. However, [Ash] and his friends appear lost and [Ash] blows up on [Misty] for her lack of directions, starting a full-scale argument among the group. They stop arguing when they spot a little girl giggle nearby bouncing a ball. She runs off as [Ash] follows. The forest gives way to a massive cliff drop-off and [Ash] plummets, but he calls out [Bulbasaur] to save him with [Vine Whip]. The [Pokémon] pulls him up to safety as they notice that the girl has disappeared. However, they spot [Saffron City] in the distance and [Ash] is excited for his upcoming [Gym] battle.
As they enter the city, [Jessie] and [James], disguised as Hawaiian women, kiss [Ash] and put leis on him. They say that [Ash] and his friends are the one-millionth, one millionth and first, one millionth and second, and one millionth and third visitors to the city and they take them to a skyscraper for a prize. When they get there, [James] grabs [Pikachu] with rubber gloves and [Jessie] pushes the three onto a warp tile, sending them to an isolated room with no exit. They find out that they were set up as a television screen drops down. When [Team Rocket] removes the disguise, [Ash] freaks out at that they both kissed him. [Team Rocket] recites their motto, but [Ash] and his friends ignore [Team Rocket]. They show [Pikachu] bound up and [Ash] orders them to give [Pikachu] back. The monitor cuts off, but [Team Rocket] did not cut the link. As [Jessie] and [James] work to fix it, [Meowth] points to the little girl that got inside, the same one [Ash] saw earlier. She emits a blue aura, freezing [Jessie] and [James], unable to move. The girl takes [Pikachu] and teleports into the same room with [Ash], giving [Pikachu] back. [Ash] thanks her, but the girl glows again and points to [Ash] and his friends, teleporting them.
When [Ash] and his friends reappear, they find themselves in front of the [Saffron [Gym]]. A man runs up behind them and informs them where they are, suggesting that they avoid the [Gym] and runs off. [Ash] ignores the warning and heads inside, intending to win the [Marsh [Badge]]. They go inside, finding it empty at first. They run into a door and look inside, finding several people in the room practicing telekinetic powers. A man confronts them and [Ash] asks for a match against [Sabrina]. When [Misty] asks what the people in the room were doing, he demonstrates by holding up a spoon and bending it a little by telekinesis. [Ash] shows off by bending the spoon completely by force, prompting the others to turn away embarrassed. The man leads them to the arena and bows down in front of a gate, asking [Sabrina] to come out. The little girl appears, her eyes glowing red, using telekinetic force to send the man running. [Ash] asks for his official match from [Sabrina] and the little girl agrees. She agrees if [Ash] and his friends play with her if he loses. The gate opens as the little girl is revealed to be sitting on the real [Sabrina]'s lap. The doors close, sealing them in.
[Sabrina] and the little girl move over telekinetically as the arena lights up. The little girl tosses a [[Poké] Ball], sending out [Abra] while [Ash] sends [Pikachu]. [Pikachu] acts aggressive but notices [Abra] is sleeping. [Pikachu] bounces around [Abra], but it is sound asleep. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] and it says that [Abra] sleeps eighteen hours a day but can employ telekinesis while asleep. [Pikachu] fires off a [ThunderShock], but [Abra] wakes up and uses [Teleport] to dodge and get behind [Pikachu]. [Abra] suddenly evolves into [Kadabra]. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] again. He thinks that it is unfair due to it being a one on one match, but evolving during the match does not count as using two [Pokémon]. [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to fill the stadium with lightning to negate [Kadabra]'s teleportation. [Pikachu] launches several bolts of electricity into the ceiling, pooling it into a massive blast and sending it down towards [Kadabra]. It uses [Confusion] to coalesce the attack and send it back to [Pikachu] as a dragon, causing serious damage. It uses [Psychic] to control [Pikachu]'s body, forcing him to get up and dance. [Kadabra] suddenly sends [Pikachu] up towards the ceiling and back down, repeating the attack several times before [Ash] decides to forfeit the match.
Since he lost, he has to fulfill the request of being the little girl's friend. She employs telekinesis to teleport them to another area. They reappear in a deserted town. They check the nearest house and find it empty. However, there is a set table complete with cake. [Ash] checks around as [Brock] samples the cake. When he bites into it, he finds it to be a plastic fake. [Ash] enters the bathroom and sees a woman in the bathtub. He turns away, but [Pikachu] points to the mirror, noticing that the figure is really a doll. [Misty] and [Brock] realize that they are in a dollhouse. The place rumbles as the house roof comes away, showing a giant [Sabrina] and the little girl towering above them. She slams her hand into the dollhouse as they run away, noticing that they were shrunk by telekinesis and are in her toy box. The little girl laughs uncontrollably as [Ash] and his friends run into a picture frame, showing the little girl and her parents. With nowhere to run, the little girl approaches, dribbling a ball and rolling it towards [Ash] and company. The man they ran into earlier appears and uses teleportation to get them out.
[Ash] and company reappear in Saffron as the man orders them to leave, mentioning that [Sabrina] is very dangerous. [Ash] is not willing to leave without the [Badge] and thinks that he just needs to attack faster to beat [Sabrina]. The man's eyes glow red as he employs telekinesis on [Ash], dropping his pants and forcing him to dance which makes [Misty] cover her eyes. The man laughs as he stops the telekinesis. [Ash] pulls up his pants unabashed and charges forward and asks to be taught telekinesis, but the man pushes him back, mentioning that a person must be born with it. [Ash] is still determined and steps forward as the man forces him to the ground. [Ash] gets back up as the man continues to use telekinesis to push [Ash] to the ground. He continues to crawl forward, shocking the man as he asks for help. It convinces the man to tell [Ash] that [Ghost] [Pokémon] can beat [Sabrina], found in [Lavender Town]. The man teleports away as his friends help [Ash] up. [Ash] decides to go to [Lavender Town] as the man reappears nearby and mentions that he may be able to help [Sabrina]. [Ash] and his friends press on to [Lavender Town]. Meanwhile, [Meowth] drags [Jessie] and [James], still frozen, as they follow.


After the events of the previous episode, [Ash] and his friends are heading to [Lavender Town] so [Ash] can catch a [[Ghost]-type] [Pokémon] to use against [Sabrina]. As they are hiking, the fog intensifies and [Brock] suggests that everyone should hold hands. [Ash] and [Misty] link up but [Brock] cannot find them. [Brock] reaches towards [Ash]'s hand, but mistakenly grabs [Pikachu]'s tail, resulting in [Pikachu] shocking [Brock]. [Ash] scares everyone by wearing a skull mask. He wants to help them get over their fear, but it makes everyone angry, including [Pikachu], who shocks him.
The group arrives in [Lavender Town] and reaches the [[Pokémon] Tower] by dark. [Misty] and [Brock] want to let [Ash] go in alone, scared off by the tower. [Ash] still wants to go in, but [Pikachu] does not, wanting to sleep. [Ash] gets his sleeping bag and wants to hold until the morning, but [Misty] wakes them up by smacking a gong. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] watches them from one of the windows inside the tower. [James] runs off, but he falls through a hole in the floor. [Jessie] and [Meowth] look down and see [James], but [Meowth] notices a closet opening nearby, a [Gastly] coming out and scaring [Meowth]. [Meowth] points to it, but it disappears before [Jessie] sees it. [Gastly] goes over [Jessie]'s face, mimicking [Jessie]'s speech, and [Meowth] attacks, scratching [Jessie]. [Jessie] angrily uses a pan to knock [Meowth] around and down into the hole with [James]. [Jessie] looks at herself in a mirror and sees [Gastly], scaring her enough to send her falling down the hole with the others. The three of them open another hole and fall down, the scream audible to [Ash] and the others. [Team Rocket] gets back up, but [Gastly] scares them again, knocking them out.
Outside, [Ash] and his friends decide to go in, but [Misty] and [Brock] push [Ash] forward first. They enter the tower, and the door closes on its own, putting them into a pitch-black room. [Ash] sends out [Charmander] to light the room with a [Flamethrower], but it exhausts the [Pokémon]. [Brock] finds a candle and [Charmander] uses [Flamethrower] to light the candle, but it unintentionally torches [Brock]. [Ash] and his friends find the hole in the floor as they explore, hearing strange noises echoing. In another portion of the tower, a [Haunter] and [Gengar] are watching TV, laughing at the comedy show broadcast. [Gastly] comes into the room and they all laugh.
[Ash] and co. continue exploring, entering a larger room. The room suddenly lights up as they make it out as a dining room, the table fully set. There is a rope above the table that has a note saying, "Pull this." [Ash] pulls it and it releases confetti and a sign saying, "Welcome." Suddenly, the glassware and chairs begin to levitate. [Brock] gets thrown around in a chair while [Pikachu] and [Charmander] get thrown around on platters. [Ash] and [Misty] run out of the room as [Brock] and the [Pokémon] jump off and run out. The tableware and chairs reset as the [Ghost] [Pokémon] show up, laughing at the mischief.
Outside, everyone is exhausted from running, [Misty] and [Brock] fully convinced not to go back in. [Ash] still wants to go in, but his [Pokémon] are not as willing. [Ash] tries to convince them as [Pikachu] remembers losing to [Kadabra]. [Ash] and his [Pokémon] are willing to take another shot, but [Misty] and [Brock] still want to stay behind. They go back inside and face the hole [Team Rocket] created earlier. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] about [Ghost] [Pokémon] as they approach the hole. They hear commotion and think the [Pokémon] are down there. [Pikachu] attacks with an electric attack, hitting [Team Rocket]. [Charmander] uses [Flamethrower] to burn [Team Rocket], creating a fire. [Ash] throws a [[Poké] Ball], but it hits [Jessie] in the face. [Jessie] gets angry as her hair catches fire. She runs around, creating a fireball from [Ash]'s view. [Haunter] gets behind [Ash] as [Pikachu] spots it and freaks out, but [Ash] misses it. [Haunter] appears in front of [Ash] and spooks him as he checks his [Pokédex]. There is no data, so [Ash] sends [Charmander], but the [Pokémon] disappears. It appears behind [Ash] and taps his shoulder. He thinks it's [Pikachu], but he sees the hand and spooks out. [Ash] sends [Charmander] to use [Leer]. They both pull off fierce looks, but [Charmander] suddenly makes a funny face, making [Haunter] laugh. [Ash] scolds it as [Charmander] scratches his head, but [Haunter] appears in front of [Charmander] and [[Licks]] him.
[Ash] recalls [Charmander], [Haunter] still laughing. [Gengar] materializes through the floor right in front of [Ash] before smacking him with a fan. Both ghosts are laughing as [Ash] checks his [Pokédex], but there is still no information. [Gengar] smacks [Haunter] with the fan and laughs, but [Ash] does not find it funny. They try to make [Ash] laugh, but it does not work. The [Pokémon] are clearly upset as they sink into the floor. [Ash] and [Pikachu] jump after them to stop them, but they miss, [Ash] crashing into the floor. The rattle drops a chandelier on top of them, knocking them out. [Pikachu] lights the chandelier with electricity. The [Ghost] [Pokémon] applaud at the show, but when the chandelier loses electricity, [Gengar] taps them as [Haunter] goes up to them and pulls ghost forms of [Ash] and [Pikachu] out. They wake up and are shocked at seeing their bodies on the ground. The [Ghost] [Pokémon] take [Ash] and [Pikachu] to the top of the tower. Outside, they admire the view as [Ash] sees [Misty] and [Brock] waiting. [Ash] listens in on the conversation as [Misty] mentions that he is taking too long, wanting to go in and check on him. [Ash] speaks as [Misty] looks behind her, hearing [Ash]'s voice. [Ash] pulls [Misty] into the air before dropping her, [Brock] catching her. [Misty] gets up and runs into the tower, [Brock] following, while [Ash] and [Pikachu] fly with the [Ghost] [Pokémon]. [Haunter] gets in front of [Ash] as he goes through [Haunter]'s mouth. Everyone laughs, having fun.
The [Pokémon] take [Ash] and [Pikachu] to a room holding several toys. The [Ghost] [Pokémon] were not trying to scare people, as they just wanted new playmates. [Ash] has to turn down the playtime in order to continue his quest, upsetting the [Ghost]. Meanwhile, [Misty] and [Brock] find [Ash] and [Pikachu]'s bodies, pulling them out from under the chandelier and trying to wake them. Both are clearly worried, but [Misty] voices more concern for [Ash]. [Ash] and [Pikachu] return to their bodies and wake up. [Misty] and [Brock] are relieved that they are okay, with [Misty] on the verge of crying.
They leave the tower the next day, [Ash] deciding not to catch the [Ghost] [Pokémon]. He wants to use humor, as [Pikachu] points out. [Haunter] is behind them and scares [Misty] and [Brock] away. [Haunter] decides to join [Ash]. Meanwhile, the [Ghost] [Pokémon] tie [Team Rocket] onto the carousel and send them spinning.


After a brief recap of the previous episode, [Ash] and his friends return to [Saffron City] with [Haunter] in tow. [Ash] is feeling confident, but [Brock] is somewhat afraid of [Haunter]. However, [Misty] is not, [Haunter] hugging up and licking [Misty]'s face, paralyzing her. [Ash] scolds it and [Haunter] cries, but [Ash] reassures it, the [Pokémon] quickly perking up. [Ash] asks [Haunter] for help against [Sabrina], and it agrees to.
[Ash] and his friends return to the [Saffron [Gym]] as [Ash] remembers the last match. He is ready to go inside, but he notices that his friends and [Pikachu] do not want to go in, based on what happened last time. [Ash] believes he will win, but [Brock] thinks [Haunter] is controlling [Ash]. [Haunter] appears not to be, laughing continually. [Ash] brings out [Charmander], [Squirtle] and [Bulbasaur] and they prepare to go inside. Everyone returns to the stadium, as [Ash] demands a rematch. [Sabrina] agrees and sends out [Kadabra]. [Ash] attempts to send out [Haunter], but [Haunter] has disappeared. [Ash] freaks out, losing his confidence. [Sabrina] starts to get angry and orders [Ash] to send out another [Pokémon] or they will all return to the toy box. [Ash] tries to send [Pikachu], but he backs away to the wall, scared. His other [Pokémon] do the same, not wanting to battle. [Sabrina] is purely angry as [Ash] decides to back out, running away, everyone following him. The exit seals off as the little girl appears from behind, using telekinesis to turn [Brock] and [Misty] into dolls. The little girl appears in front of them as [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]] hide behind him. The man that told him to find the [[Ghost]-type] [Pokémon] before appears and teleports them out.
They reappear in the city and they all drop into a pile atop the man. [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]] relax as [Ash] reflects on how mean [Sabrina] is. The man mentions that [Sabrina] was not always mean. Flashbacks reveal [Sabrina] as a young girl using telekinetic powers on everything, honing her skills at the cost of turning against her parents. The conflict caused her to split into two girls, the older [Trainer] and the lonely little girl. The little girl is actually a doll representing [Sabrina] before she practiced telekinesis. [Ash] notices that the picture he showed is the same one they saw in [Sabrina]'s toy box. The man believes that [Ash] has found out that he is really [Sabrina]'s father, but [Ash] thinks he is a photographer. [Pikachu] laughs and the man is somewhat astounded that [Ash] is that oblivious. [Sabrina]'s father asks why he does not have a [Ghost] [Pokémon] as [Ash] mentions that [Haunter] disappeared. He must find [Haunter] in order to free his friends.
[Ash] and [Pikachu] scan the city for [Haunter]. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is alongside a skyscraper on a platform. [James] readies the fishing net in order to capture [Pikachu], but [Haunter] appears in front of them, scaring [Team Rocket] and causing them to fall off the platform. [Jessie] grabs hold as everyone else clings onto her. She cannot pull up because they are too heavy. [Haunter] appears next to [Jessie] and makes funny faces, trying to get her to laugh (he even fires a gun with a "BANG!" flag in the barrel). She tries to resist because she will let go if she laughs. Eventually she cracks, laughing and releasing her grip. They crash through the sidewalk as [Ash] and [Pikachu] notice, [Haunter] appearing nearby. [Ash] wants to go back to the [Gym], but [Haunter] does not want to battle. However, [Haunter] comes up with an idea and sides with [Ash] again as they return to the [Gym].
Meanwhile, [Misty] and [Brock], now as dolls, are sitting on a couch, unable to move. They notice another doll nearby as they realize that it is [Sabrina]'s mother. They are shocked as she reveals that [Sabrina] is still good. The roof opens as the [Sabrina] doll looks down upon them. [Misty] demands a battle and for them to change them back, but she doesn't want them to change. [Ash] returns and asks for another match. [Misty] and [Brock] protest, but [Ash] is set to battle. [Kadabra] comes back out as [Ash] orders [Haunter] to go, but it disappears again. This time, there is no backing out as [Ash] freaks out. [Ash] falls to the floor in defeat, but [Pikachu] steps out to battle, even though [Ash] knows [Pikachu] is at a disadvantage. [Pikachu] wants to stand up for [Ash] as the battle begins. [Pikachu] uses [[Thunder] Shock], but [Kadabra] [Teleports] to avoid it. It uses [Psybeam] to knock [Pikachu] back. [Pikachu] gets back up and uses a [Thunderbolt], hitting and roasting [Kadabra]. It seems like a win, but [Kadabra] uses [Recover] to heal. The battle seems to be against [Ash], but suddenly, [Haunter] appears in front of [Sabrina] and laughs. The doll believes that it is unfair to pit two against one, but [Sabrina]'s dad reappears and says that [Haunter] is playing on its own, not battling, so it is not against the rules. [Haunter] makes funny faces and even pulls out a bomb, exploding it in front of [Sabrina]. The effort works as [Sabrina] cracks a smile, progressing to hysterical laughter. [Sabrina]'s dad seems happy at [Sabrina]'s breakthrough, but [Ash] is still unconvinced that he is her dad, making him angry. However, he notes that [Haunter] has helped [Sabrina]. [Ash] is still angry that he did not win, but [Sabrina]'s dad points to [Kadabra] rolling on the floor laughing, since [Sabrina] and [Kadabra] are joined telepathically. [Sabrina]'s doll disappears and drops [Kadabra]'s [[Poké] Ball], [Misty] and [Brock] returning to human form. [Sabrina]'s father declares [Ash] the winner.
[Ash] and his friends leave [Saffron City], [Ash] glancing at his new [Marsh [Badge]]. [Haunter] stays behind with [Sabrina], and the group makes plans to head off to the next [Gym] in [[Celadon] City]. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is frozen in the pit being filled with cement, but they manage to get out and blast off.


The scene opens at [[Professor [Oak]]'s [Laboratory]] as he sips tea. The phone rings as [[Ash]'s [Krabby]] brings it to him. [Ash] is on the other line as he shows off his four [Badges]. [Professor [Oak]] approves, but he mentions that [Gary] and the others all have five [Badges] and have already passed through [[Celadon] City]. It makes [Ash] even more furious that [Gary] has caught thirty [Pokémon]. [Oak] mentions that [Ash] should catch more [Pokémon] in order to become a better [Trainer]. He ends the call, leaving [Ash] upset.
[Misty] and [Pikachu] are eating rice balls as [Misty] notices [Ash]'s mood. [Ash] mentions how far behind he is as [Brock] points down the path to [[Celadon] City]. [Misty] mentions that [Ash] needs to get there his own way as [Brock] mentions quality over quantity. [Pikachu] notices a [Mankey] peeking from behind a rock nearby as [Ash] checks his [Pokédex]. [Mankey] hops over [Brock], wanting the rice ball. It takes it and climbs atop a rock, eating it. [Ash] decides to catch it by merely throwing a [[Poké] Ball] at it. [Mankey] throws the rice ball which the [[Poké] Ball] catches, and it then hops off, clearly angry. The [Pokédex] mentions that once it goes into [Thrash], it is hard to stop. [Mankey] charges and everyone runs away. [Brock] tries to stop it by throwing it a rice ball, but it destroys it with its fist. [Misty] trips and it appears [Mankey] will attack her, but it jumps off her head to land on [Ash], pounding on him. [Mankey] leaves [Ash] beaten and without his hat as it climbs atop a tree and wears the hat. Nearby, [Team Rocket] watches, wanting to catch [Pikachu] and get a promotion. [Meowth] makes a smart remark as [Jessie] rolls a yarn ball at [Meowth], pacifying the [Pokémon].
[Ash] gets up and notices his hat is missing. [Ash] confronts [Mankey] as the [Pokémon] mocks [Ash], imitating him twisting his hat back and throwing the [[Poké] Ball]. [Ash] climbs the tree to reclaim the hat. He mentions that the hat was one he won at the [[Pokémon] League] Expo and that the hat is very rare. A commercial flashback plays out and shows how rare the hat is. [Misty] remembers trying to win that hat, but [Ash] beat her by sending in "about a million postcards". [Ash] manages to get high enough on the tree, but [Mankey] jumps off, sending [Ash] back down. [Team Rocket] steps out to confront them, but [Mankey] checks out [Team Rocket]. [James] kicks [Mankey] away. [Brock] tells [Team Rocket] to leave before it whips them. [Team Rocket] turns, seeing the angry [Pokémon] evolving into [Primeape].
[Ash] checks his [Pokédex] about [Primeape] as [Team Rocket] decides to ignore it, sending out [Ekans] and [Koffing]. [Primeape] attacks [Jessie], sending her flying face-first into a rock. She gets angry and orders the [Pokémon] to attack [Primeape] instead. [Meowth], [James] and [Jessie] jump into the melee as [Ash]'s friends drag him away. [Ash] notices his hat and [Pikachu] runs for it. [Primeape] beats [Team Rocket] and gets between [Pikachu] and [Ash]'s hat. [Pikachu] tries not to look at [Primeape] in the eye, but he eventually does, nervously backing away as it reclaims the hat. [Pikachu] attacks with [[Thunder] Shock], but it only makes [Primeape] angrier. [Brock] thinks [Primeape] is scared of them and approaches it, but it pounds on [Brock] and sends him flying. [Primeape] continues to [Thrash] and runs after [Ash] and [Misty]. They run away as [Team Rocket] pursues them as well. [Ash] and [Misty] split up, [Primeape] following [Ash]. [Brock] catches up with [Misty] as they decide to catch up to [Ash].
[Ash] keeps running as [Primeape] destroys boulders in its path. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] sets up a pit trap in [Ash]'s path. They see dust in the distance as [Ash] and [Pikachu] plunge in, [Primeape] managing to stop in time. [Koffing] releases gas as [Ash] confronts [Team Rocket]. [Pikachu] attacks with [[Thunder] Shock], hurting [Team Rocket] and [Ash]. [Ash] sees [Primeape] as it jumps in. [Ash] scrambles out but [Primeape] jumps in front of him, staring him in the eye. [Ash] remembers what [Oak] said and decides to get serious and catch [Primeape]. [Misty] insists for [Ash] to forget it, but [Ash] wants to face it to get stronger. He sends [Squirtle] to fire [[Water] Gun], but it makes [Primeape] angrier. [Ash] sends [Bulbasaur] to use [Razor Leaf], but [Primeape] punches them, destroying the leaves. [Ash] sends [Charmander] out, using [Flamethrower], but [Primeape] dodges before pounding on [Charmander] with several punches. [Primeape] is relentless as [Charmander]'s flame suddenly grows. The [Pokédex] points the move [Rage] as [Charmander] gains more power. [Charmander] takes more punches before biting [Primeape]'s fist, but it tosses the [Pokémon] aside. [Charmander] fires another [Flamethrower] as [Pikachu] jumps and grabs the hat, escaping before the attack roasts [Primeape]. [Primeape] slumps as [Ash] tosses the [[Poké] Ball]. [Primeape] goes inside as the Ball rattles. It stops, the catch an apparent success. The Ball rattles again, but it stops a second time, this time inert as [Ash] claims the Ball holding his [Primeape].
[Pikachu] gives [Ash] his hat back as [Team Rocket] climbs out of the hole. They wonder where [Primeape] is as [Ash] throws the ball in. [Primeape] jumps out and pounds [Team Rocket], sending them flying. [Ash] pets [Primeape], but it gives [Ash] a black eye. [Ash] recalls his [Charmander] and [Primeape]. [Pikachu] points over the cliff as they see [[Celadon] City]. [Misty] notes that [Primeape]'s chase sped up the trip. [Ash] puts his hat on, as he is excited to get the next [Badge]. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] lands in a field full of angry [Primeape]. The [Primeape] pound on [Team Rocket] as [Meowth] wishes for donuts.


[Ash] and his friends have reached [[Celadon] City], renowned for the skyscrapers filling the city. Everyone but [Ash] notice a wonderful smell in the air as [Brock] runs off. [Ash] finds him with his face against a store window, noticing several girls inside. [Ash] thinks [Brock] is wasting time and proceeds to leave, but [Misty] and [Pikachu] are not around. [Brock] points inside as [Ash] looks. [Misty] and [Pikachu] are inside the perfume store admiring the variety of aromas. [Misty] asks about how much it will cost, but [Ash] steps inside and urges her not to waste her money. The female manager confronts [Ash] about his negative claim, but [Ash] pushes it further by saying all perfumes are a waste and turn guys into zombies, pointing to [Brock]. Everyone in the store is against [Ash] about his remark, even his own friends, as they kick him out. [Ash] storms away and heads to the [[Celadon] [Gym]], but when he tries to enter, none of the [Trainers] are willing to let him in. They know about his perfume distaste since the perfume originates from the [Gym]. The lead [Trainer] plants a red cross stamp on [Ash]'s face before kicking him out and closing the doors.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] sets up a ladder to sneak into the [Gym] and steal the perfume formula. They explore the interior forest as [Jessie] runs into a [Gloom]. [James] waves at [Gloom]'s face, waking it up. [James] sends out his [Koffing] to launch [Poison Gas], but [Gloom] is unaffected by the attack, breathing it as if it were fresh air. [Gloom] responds by releasing its stench, the putrid smell instantly knocking out [Team Rocket]. [Meowth] is unaffected since he does not have a nose, but the [Trainers] knock [Meowth] out with a hammer before planting red cross marks on all three of them, taking them outside and suspending them from a tree branch.
[Ash] runs into [Team Rocket] tied up in the tree. [James] asks [Ash] to free them, but [Jessie] refuses at first. She then decides to taunt [Ash] for not getting into the [Gym]. [Jessie] offers to help [Ash] get inside the [Gym] if he releases them. Though reluctant at first, [Ash] does not want to pass up the opportunity to get the [Badge]. They go to the department store and [Team Rocket] dresses [Ash] up in a dress and a blonde wig. [Ash] speaks about wanting to get back at the [Trainers], but [Team Rocket] subtly point out that [Ash] needs to change his voice. [Ash] coughs and speaks again in a high-pitched voice, setting up his disguise.
[Jessie] and [James] dress up as [Ash]'s parents and go to the [Gym] to enroll [Ash] in the [Pokémon] training classes under the name [Ashley]. [Ash] notices that the girl registering him into the class was the same one he saw at the store, but the disguise holds and he is successfully admitted. [Team Rocket] runs off to find the secret perfume formula while [Ash] unintentionally distracts the [Trainers]. [Meowth], hiding under [James]'s disguise, pulls out a blaster ball, asking what to do with it, and [Jessie] orders [Meowth] to plant it.
The [Gym] [Trainers] work out with their [[Grass]-type] [Pokémon] while [Erika] finishes telling a story to the group. [Ash] enters the room and finds [Misty] and [Brock] in the group. [Ash] finds out that [Erika] is not only the [[Gym] Leader], but she is also the store manager that kicked him out. [Brock] steps forward to introduce the seemingly shy [Ashley] as [Ash] notices [Pikachu] in the group as well. [Misty] asks [Erika] why [Gloom] does not emit its horrible smell. [Erika] points out that as long as [Gloom] feels safe, it will not smell. [Erika] recounts on how she first met [Gloom] when she was a child and ran into a wild [Grimer]. [Gloom] came by and used its stench to send [Grimer] scurrying. As [Erika] finishes the story, [Misty] wishes that [Ash] could have heard the story. [Ash] responds in his normal voice, raising suspicion as [Misty] takes a closer look at [Ash]. [Pikachu] gets closer and hugs [Ash]'s leg. He pushes him away, making him angrily shock him, breaking the disguise. [Ash] drops the facade and challenges [Erika] to a battle. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] breaks into the safe holding the perfume.
[Erika] accepts the challenge and sets up a three-on-three battle. [Ash] sends out [Bulbasaur] while [Erika] sends out [Tangela], which prompts [Ash] to check his [Pokédex]. [Bulbasaur] attacks with [Vine Whip], but [Tangela] uses [Constrict] to pull [Bulbasaur] closer before following up with [Stun [Spore]], paralyzing [Bulbasaur]. [Ash] recalls [Bulbasaur] and [Erika] offers to treat it with [[Parlyz] Heal], but he refuses and considers using [Primeape], but knowing how unruly the [Pokémon] is, he changes his mind and sends out [Charmander]. [Erika] sends out [Weepinbell] and opens with a [Razor Leaf] attack. [Charmander] uses [Flamethrower] to stop the attack and send it back as fireballs. [Charmander] uses [Skull Bash] to knock out [Weepinbell]. [Erika] points out [Ash]'s lack of empathy towards his [Pokémon] as she sends out [Gloom]. It releases its stench and upon smelling it, [Charmander] jumps into the air, holding its nose before fainting. [Ash] tries to decide between his other [Pokémon] on who should go, but [Pikachu] steps forward and offers to battle. [Ash] is not optimistic, but [Pikachu] is confident that he will win.
[Team Rocket] interrupts the battle and jumps down to the battlefield. [Meowth] detonates the blaster ball, which is still on [Meowth], sending them blasting off, but they manage to escape with the perfume. The bomb starts a massive fire as the [Trainers] quickly recall their [Pokémon]. Everyone gets outside as the fire grows out of control and threatens to destroy the [Gym]. Everyone tries to put the fire out, but the attempts are not very effective. [Ash] feels guilty that he allowed [Team Rocket] inside, but [Misty] snaps him out of it. He sends [Squirtle] while [Misty] sends out [Staryu] and [Starmie] to fire [[Water] Gun] at the fire. [Brock] sends [Geodude] to drop dirt on the flames. As they begin to get a hold on the fire, [Erika] runs around, frantic because she cannot find [Gloom]. She thinks [Gloom] is still inside and attempts to run in, but [Misty] stops her. [Ash] runs in instead. He finds [Gloom] scared, but as he approaches, [Gloom] releases its smell. The ceiling begins to cave in around [Gloom]. [Ash] takes a chance and holds his breath as he rushes into the room. He gets up to [Gloom], but can no longer hold his breath as he takes a breath, but he finds no smell because he remembers the story that [Gloom] will not stink if it feels safe.
[Ash] runs out of the burning [Gym] with [Gloom] in hand as everyone congratulates [Ash] for his bravery. The next day, [Erika] presents the [Rainbow [Badge]] to [Ash] because he saved [Gloom]. [Ash] points out the lost potion, but [Erika] points out that the bottle held [Gloom]'s scent. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] opens the bottle, the contents knocking them out. [Ash] now has five [Badges] and they move on to the next town.


[Ash] and his friends arrive in a new city filled with skyscrapers, [[HopHopHop] Town]. As they are walking the streets, a woman runs up, calling for her son, Arnold, and embracing [Ash] by mistake. Once [Ash] clears up the misunderstanding, the crew learns that the woman's son, Arnold, as well as many other children have all disappeared. [Officer Jenny] pulls up to add another missing child poster, and [Brock] immediately volunteers to help solve the mystery. [Ash] is reminded of his own mother and takes it upon himself to solve the mystery. It turns out the children have all been missing for the past three days. The crew arrives at the [[Pokémon] Center], and begins asking around. [Nurse Joy] then reveals another mystery. The [Pokémon] in the center have all lost their energy as of three days ago. Suddenly, a device on [Officer Jenny]'s hip starts beeping. Jenny explains that she is tracking sleep waves that have been appearing in the city.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is also tracking the source of the sleep waves. They have arrived at this city, and they are plotting to snatch the source in order to put [the [Boss]] to sleep. While he is asleep, they plan to take a vacation. The scene ends as they all weep about not having had a vacation in so long. [Ash] and the group track the sleep waves to the roof of an enormous skyscraper. As they step off the elevator, they discover a huge mansion at the end of a trimmed walkway. [Ash] takes initiative and he and [Brock] burst through the door. To their surprise, there is a formal gathering of well dressed adults, and a podium on which rest [Drowzee] and [Hypno]. The adults explain that their old [Drowzee] finally evolved to [Hypno] three days ago, and they have been using [Hypno]'s sleep waves instead of sleeping pills. Finally, a man explains that they are the members of the [Pokémon] Lover's Club, who have all grown to love [Hypno] the most. They had been working hard so that their [Drowzee] would evolve. Apparently, the city life is stressful on the members, and so they have turned into insomniacs. The only cure they could find was [Hypno]'s sleep waves.
However, as [Brock] deduces, [Hypno]'s hypnosis is generally used on [Pokémon]. When altered to affect people, it has side affects that cause [Pokémon] to lose energy, and possibly affect extra sensitive kids. [Misty], curious as to this last idea, allows herself to be hypnotized by [Hypno]. [Hypno] starts its [Hypnosis] and she suddenly begins acting like a [Seel], and runs out of the mansion, and into the park surrounding the mansion. It opens up into a clearing revealing not only [Misty], but all the missing children, acting like [Pokémon]. [Brock] explains that the affliction, "Pokémonitis," caused by [Hypno]'s waves, is causing all the children to believe they are [Pokémon]. [Officer Jenny] attempts to awaken the children from their hypnosis, but it is of no use. The head of the club suggests using [Drowzee]'s sleep attacks to induce dream wavelengths to counteract [Hypno]'s wavelengths.
Back in the mansion, [Drowzee] uses its ability to put [Misty] into a trance. Finally, it claps, awakening [Misty] from both the trance, and the hypnosis. Relieved that this solution worked, [Ash] carries [Drowzee] back to the clearing to cure the other children. En route, [Team Rocket] soars down from the sky on hang gliders, reciting the motto, with a snappy, "[Meowth], that's flight!" On the ground, [Jessie] pulls out a mirror, and they try to get [Hypno] to hypnotize itself. [Ash], with some fast thinking, throws a potted plant, smashing the mirror. Not yet finished, [Team Rocket] breaks out the whips and snares [Drowzee] and [Hypno]. When asked why they didn't start off with this strategy [Jessie] remarks, "We have to fill the half hour." [Ash] holds onto [Drowzee] while [Misty] cuts the whips with [Staryu]. [Ash] calls [Pidgeotto] to gust [Team Rocket] away. With the Rockets out of the way, they use [Drowzee] to cure the children, who awaken, and run home. Also the woman from the beginning runs up and embraces her son as well. They head back to the [[Pokémon] Center] and cure the [Pokémon] there. [Misty] wonders what they dream about. [Brock] suspects they dream of getting stronger and evolving.
[Nurse Joy] then sighs that [Psyduck] is still holding its head. [Brock], as a [[Pokémon] [Breeder]], volunteers to take it, but shortly after heading out, attempts to foist it off on [Misty], claiming that as a [[Water]-type] [Pokémon], it should go to her. [Misty] does not want such a boring [Pokémon], and refuses. [Ash]'s [Pokédex] reports that [Psyduck] always has a headache, and [Misty], in a fit of shock trips over a rock and a [[Poké] Ball] rolls out of her bag in front of the unfortunate Duck [Pokémon]. [Psyduck] pecks the Ball, and is caught, much to [Misty]'s dismay.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] find themselves on [Scissor Street], a location colloquially referred to as [Breeder]'s Lane that [Brock] explains is well known for its [Pokémon] salons and beauty parlors. [Misty], with [Ash] in tow, pauses outside of one venue in particular to examine a poster featuring a [Koffing] and [Ekans] adorned with a number of gaudy accessories. Debating whether or not to join the throng of apparently eager customers vying to get inside the Salon Roquet, she is interrupted by [Brock] who announces that he has "found it". [Ash] and [Misty] follow him the short distance to a storefront that is much less crowded and rather bland compared to its neighbors, whereupon [Brock] is suddenly struck by a fit of apparent nervousness and freezes. Oblivious, [Ash] and [Misty] enter first and are greeted by a feminine voice that serves the added effect of snapping [Brock] back to reality.
Inside they meet a [[Pokémon] [Breeder]], who introduces herself as [Suzie], gently massaging a [Chansey]; however, [Misty] has shifted her attention to a [Vulpix] that is fast asleep on a chair. [Ash] scans it with his [Pokédex] while [Misty] approaches the sleeping [Pokémon]. [Misty], obviously enthralled by the cute creature, scoops it up in her arms while offering numerous compliments. [Vulpix] is understandably annoyed by this interruption of its afternoon nap and reacts with a [Flamethrower] directed at [Misty]'s face.
[Brock], who has been unusually silent up to this point, suddenly blurts out that he wants to become [Suzie]'s pupil. Everyone is shocked, especially [Suzie]. [Brock] explains that [Suzie] is a highly accomplished breeder who he idolizes.
Later, [Suzie] serves tea for the three while [Pikachu] happily munches on some food. [Suzie] compliments [Pikachu]'s shiny coat, and asks if [Brock] made his food. [Brock] replies that he did, and [Misty] explains that it is [Brock]'s own recipe. [Suzie] explains that she too got into [Pokémon] breeding because of her interest in [Pokémon] nutrition. During this exchange [Vulpix] suddenly leaps up to the bowl of food, sniffing at it curiously. [Pikachu] offers [Vulpix] the piece he was eating, and [Vulpix] accepts it. This surprises [Suzie], who explains that [Vulpix] usually does not eat anything she has not made herself.
[Misty] then mentions all the flashily dressed [Pokémon] they saw outside. [Suzie] points out that ever since Salon Roquet opened up, [Trainers] have been focusing on making their [Pokémon] look as flashy as possible. [Ash] says that looking flashy is dumb, but [Misty] counters that even [Pokémon] like to dress up once in a while. This leads to an argument between [Ash] and [Misty] about what is more important for a [Pokémon] and its [Trainer]: the inside or the outside. [Ash] jokingly suggests that, if fashion is so important to [Misty], she should take her [Psyduck] over to Salon Roquet. [Misty] loves the idea, and calls out [Psyduck], much to [Ash]'s amusement.
After [Misty] leaves, [Suzie] expresses doubt in her own methods, but [Brock] and [Ash] quickly reassure her. [Brock] suggests a way in which [Suzie] can compete with the growing popularity of salons like Salon Roquet: by combining style and substance. Soon thereafter, [Suzie] gives a lecture on [Pokémon] breeding and treatment. She explains that if a [Pokémon] has been injured in a battle, it should be given a therapeutic massage, which she demonstrates on [Pikachu]. As [Brock] had hoped, [Suzie]'s lecture starts to draw the crowd away from Salon Roquet. As [Suzie], [Ash], and [Brock] demonstrate the importance of good communication between [Pokémon] and [Trainer], [Trainers] arriving from Salon Roquet begin to doubt if they made the right choice.
Meanwhile, at Salon Roquet, [Jessie] orders [Meowth] to send in the next customer. It is then that it is revealed that [Team Rocket] is running the salon. He complains that he is too busy counting the money they have made, but then realizes there is only one customer left: [Misty], with her [Psyduck]. [Team Rocket] drag her in for a makeover of her own, her protests that [Psyduck] was the one who needed the makeover falling upon deaf ears. She loves the bright and flashy results, however, and asks the undercover [Jessie] and [James] to continue.
[Meowth] then mentions [Pikachu], tipping [Misty] off to his identity. [Misty] screams that she will never tell [Team Rocket] anything, but [James] threatens to paint her face like [Frankenstein] if she does not. Thinking that over for a moment, she suddenly realizes that [Psyduck] has gone missing. In fact, [Psyduck] has run back to [Suzie]'s salon, where it goes into a panic. [Pikachu] signals that [Misty] is in danger, and takes off with [Brock], [Ash], and [Suzie] behind him. They make their way back to Salon Roquet, where they face off against [Team Rocket].
They are startled to see what [Team Rocket] has done to [Misty]'s face, but [Team Rocket] defends the bizarre makeover, claiming they are conducting "important beauty research" on her. This starts an argument between [Suzie] and [Team Rocket] about whether beauty is on the inside or the outside. [Meowth], however, interrupts by revealing [Team Rocket]'s fraudulent intentions.
[Team Rocket] offers a trade: [Misty] for [Pikachu]. [Ash] refuses and challenges them to a battle. [Team Rocket], however, has prepared for this, and pushes a button on a microphone, which reveals their latest invention, the Salon Roquet Battling Platform. To begin the battle, [Jessie] sends out [Ekans], and [James] sends out [Koffing], both of which are still dressed in their ridiculous outfits. [Ash] sends out [Pikachu], and [Brock] uses [Geodude]. [Brock] orders a [Seismic Toss], and [Geodude] carries [Ekans] into the air and flings it down. However, [Ekans] turns the momentum of the throw into a spinning wheel strike and slams into [Pikachu]. [Ash] calls for a [ThunderShock], but the spinning of [Koffing] and [Ekans] makes their extravagant outfits deflect the lightning. [James] then orders a "[Sludge] makeover", blinding both [Pikachu] and [Geodude]. But as [Team Rocket]'s [Pokémon] are sent in to finish them off, [Ekans] and [Koffing] end up tripping over their outfits, halting the attack. [Meowth] tries to help the tangled [Pokémon], but [Vulpix] cuts in. [Suzie] calls that if you only focus on outer beauty, a [Pokémon]'s inner strength will be lost, which [Vulpix] drives home with a powerful [[Fire] Spin] that sends [Team Rocket] blasting off.
[Brock] takes this opportune moment to explain to the crowd that there was first-hand proof that a cute exterior hides inner strength. The crowd, taking the words to heart, begin to remove all the flashy items from their [Pokémon] and wipe off the applied makeup.
Back at her salon, [Suzie] thanks [Ash] and his friends for helping her regain confidence in her beliefs. She plans to leave the salon for a while and go on a journey to learn what it truly means to be a [Pokémon] breeder. [Suzie] says that [Brock] is the first person other than herself that [Vulpix] has shown affection to, and asks that [Brock] take care of [Vulpix] for her while she is on her journey. [Brock] gratefully accepts, and obtains the small [[Fire]-type]. Meanwhile, [Ash] looks at [Misty]'s made-up face again and cracks up laughing, angering her.
Soon enough, [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] are on their way once again, standing to wave goodbye to [Suzie]. Behind them, [Team Rocket] goes running past, pursued by a crowd of their angry former customers.


A shadowy figure is seen in the distance. As it approaches, it is discovered that the figure is a [Hitmonchan]. He suddenly stops by a nearby tree, while a girl watches the [[Fighting]-type] from behind. [Ash] and his friends are amazed, thinking it's a wild [Hitmonchan]. [Ash] tells [Pikachu] that if he can defeat [Hitmonchan], he will be a world champion [Pokémon]. However, [Pikachu] just imagines himself getting beaten up. [Ash] says that he will teach [Pikachu] his secret punch. [Misty] and [Brock] are curious about this, and question when [Ash] became a boxing expert.
[Ash] challenges [Hitmonchan], and [Pikachu] is wearing little boxing gloves. [Hitmonchan] smirks at this, but [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to attack. [Brock] and [Misty] are watching while [Ash] gives commands. [Pikachu] sends a glowing glove into [Hitmonchan]'s face. He rubs the spot where he was hit, and [Pikachu] gets scared. A man runs over, and tells [Hitmonchan] he should not let his guard down, then tells him to knock out that [Pokémon].
[Hitmonchan] creams [Ash]'s little [Pikachu]. Much to [Ash]'s disappointment, it was not a wild [Hitmonchan]. Suddenly, the girl runs out from behind the tree. She calls the man her dad, and begs him to come home, and to give up trying to become a [Trainer]. The man tells his daughter, [Rebecca], that he won't quit until he becomes the [[P1] Grand [Prix]] champion. He then informs everyone that he will be at his [Gym] and leaves.
After talking with [Rebecca], [Ash] and the others learn that [Anthony] is determined to become the [[P1] Grand [Prix]] champion, and as a result has essentially abandoned his family. Wanting to help [Rebecca] out, [Brock] volunteers his and [Ash]'s assistance, saying their [Geodude] and [Primeape] will defeat [Anthony] and his [Hitmonchan].
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] gets wind of the Grand [Prix] as well. They decide to enter to win the prize belt. [James] and [Meowth], on the other hand, want to win for the all-you-can-eat buffet. [Jessie] then gets mad at them. When they ask what she would use the money for, she tells them she would go to the salon and go on a shopping spree. When [James] points out that only [Fighting] [Pokémon] can enter, [Jessie] says that they will have to "borrow" one. They spot a tall man and his [Hitmonlee], which [James] identifies as the Kicking Fiend.
At the [[P1] Grand [Prix]], all the competitors are ready. The first battle is between a [Machop] and [[Ash]'s [Primeape]]. Despite [Ash]'s pleas, [Primeape] refuses to listen, until [Machop] launches a [Seismic Toss] and sends [Primeape] out of the ring. [Ash] rushes to save it, but misses. He then asks his [Pokémon] if it's okay. [Primeape] gives [Ash] a sad look, then shakes it off and jumps back into the ring. Now listening to [Ash], [Primeape] is able to take control and defeat the [Machop] with [Scratch] and [Mega Kick].
The next match is [Hitmonlee] versus [Geodude]. [Brock] waves to [Rebecca], saying everything is under control. Suddenly, [Rebecca] tells him to look out, and [Brock] is hit in the head with his own [Pokémon]. He sends [Geodude] back into the ring, where it is kicked mercilessly. [Anthony] approaches, telling [Brock] that a real man knows when to admit defeat. [Brock] throws in the towel, and apologizes to [Geodude] for making it battle. [Ash] promises that he and [Primeape] will take care of the tournament from that point forward.
As more battles take place throughout the tournament, [Primeape], [Hitmonchan] and [Hitmonlee] rise to the top of the ladder. The next main match is between [Hitmonchan] and [Hitmonlee]. [Jessie] is ready for anything and to make sure they win. [Meowth] squirts glue up through the floor of the arena. [Hitmonchan] steps on the glue and gets stuck, so [Anthony] has to throw in the towel. [Anthony] says he is sorry he worried [Rebecca] and her mother. [Misty] says that the fighting brought a family back together. "[Giant]" then arrives to meet with [Ash], though [James]' ill-timed poking out and responding to [Jessie] causes them to realize it was [Team Rocket] in disguise. [Jessie] and [James] then try to recite their motto, although the latter, due to obvious strain from trying to carry [Jessie], ends up collapsing before he can even finish.
Then the highly anticipated battle between [[Ash]'s [Primeape]] versus the stolen [Hitmonlee] takes place. [Primeape] blocks multiple rapid kicks from [Hitmonlee] and manages to sneak through a few hits. Under the arena [Meowth] tries to pull off another cheating move, but [Pikachu] spots him and decides to get moving. He finds that [Meowth] has planted a bomb on the stage.
Meanwhile, back on the stage [Hitmonlee] jumps up, as per the plan, [Meowth] hits the button on the controls, but the bomb does not explode. [Hitmonlee] falls down, and [Primeape] grabs him. It uses its [Seismic Toss] and wins the match. [Primeape] has now become the new [[P1] Grand [Prix]] Champion. [Ash] says he is proud of [Primeape]. [Anthony] says it has a lot of natural talent, and offers to train it for [Ash]; he promises that he will make [Primeape] a true [P1] Champion. Meanwhile, [Meowth] and the rest of [Team Rocket] are baffled as to why the bomb didn't explode. [Pikachu] then turns up and gives the bomb to [Meowth], who thanks [Pikachu] for finding it. Just at that moment, however, the bomb activates, shocking [Team Rocket] before exploding, sending them blasting off yet again.
[Ash] leaves [Primeape] with [Anthony] to train and take care of. His daughter says that she will also make sure he spends time at home. [Primeape] then gets teary-eyed, but [Ash] assures [Primeape] that they will be together again someday.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] make their way through [[Gringey] City]. The air and water there is incredibly polluted thanks to the many factories. [Ash] notices that [Pikachu] is acting weird. Sparks are coming out of his cheeks and his face is red. A shadowy [Pokémon] watches from a nearby alley.
[Ash] wears rubber gloves as he rushes [Pikachu] to the [[Pokémon] Center]. [Meowth] watches them enter from a periscope deep in the sewers. [Jessie] and [James] begin to do the motto, then complain about the horrible smell instead. [Meowth] gives them scuba suits to wear, and says he'll stay there to pump them oxygen and fresh air. [Meowth] tells them to dive into the water and swim through the pipes to the [[Pokémon] Center], but they refuse. [Meowth] pushes a button which delivers the hapless humans an electric shock. They reluctantly enter the sludge water of the sewers.
[Ash] rings the bell at the desk. A [Nurse Joy] comes out of a nearby room, yawning. It's late at night and she dismisses [Pikachu]'s condition as a cold. When [Ash] yells at her for not being very helpful, she explains that the sparks coming out of [Pikachu]'s cheeks are an early symptom of a cold in electric rodent [Pokémon]. She suggests that they leave [Pikachu] there for the night, and he will be fine in the morning.
At the same time, a large group of [Grimer] block the water flow into the hydroelectric power plant, causing the power to go out. This causes the power supply to [Team Rocket]'s scuba equipment to go dead. There are also several [Pokémon] in the intensive care unit at the Center, and if the power is not restored soon, bad things will happen! [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] decide to head for the power plant to try to do something. [Pikachu] cries out as they leave. They ask an [Officer Jenny] for directions, as [Pikachu] comes out of the nearby bushes.
[Misty] realizes that [Pikachu] is afraid that they won't come back for him later, so [Ash] decides to let him come along. [Pikachu] jumps into [Ash]'s arms and [Ash] gets shocked as the shadowy [Pokémon] watches from a nearby bush.
Somehow, [Meowth] gets [Jessie] and [James] back on the surface level as they gasp for air. [Meowth] watches as [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] race past the alley they are hiding in.
The group arrives at the power plant. They enter and nobody is there to greet them. [Misty] looks at a map and points out the direction to the central control room. [Misty] gets spooked as something flies behind her. After a philosophical discussion about [Misty]'s cowardice, both [Misty] and [Brock] spot something behind [Ash]. He turns around and nobody is there. The shadowy figure appears behind [Pikachu]. [Ash] looks it up on the [Pokédex] and it's a [Magnemite], the Magnet [Pokémon]. [Ash] decides to try to catch it, but [Magnemite] only seems interested in [Pikachu]. [Magnemite] seems to be in love with [Pikachu] for some reason.
[Ash] yells at the [Magnemite] to cut it out, and the [Magnemite] backs off. A nasty stench enters the corridor. They turn around to see a grating fall off the ceiling, followed by several [Grimer]. [Brock] decides that it would be best not to say anything to insult their pride. [Ash] pretends to compliment their unique smell, but [Misty] says it stinks, and the leader of the [Grimer], a [Muk], rises from behind them. With a command from [Muk], the [Grimer] attack. [Ash], [Misty], [Brock], and [Pikachu] run. As they round the corner, they run into two plant workers. The [Grimer] approach, and they all start running for the control room. They all hide in the control room. One of the workers explains that the [Grimer] are clogging the sea intake, preventing the power from coming back on.
The [Grimer] bust down the door. [Pikachu] uses his [[Thunder] Shock] attack to knock out some of the [Grimer], but it's not good enough. Suddenly, the [Magnemite] knocks out the grating above them, and several [Magnemite] and [Magneton] arrive. Their combined electric attack is enough to chase away all the [Grimer]. They also manage to get rid of the [Grimer] blocking the flow of water into the power plant, and the power is restored.
However, the [Muk] leader remains. [Pikachu] uses [[Thunder] Shock], and [Pikachu]'s obsessed [Magnemite] assists with a [[Thunder] Shock] of its own. The combined electric attacks knock the [Muk] unconscious, and [Ash] catches it in a [[Poké] Ball]. To his discontent, he realizes that the smell of the [Muk] comes through the [[Poké] Ball].
Everyone is now outside, and the sun is back up. [Pikachu] seems to be a lot better now. One of the power plant workers explains that when an electric mouse builds up too much electricity, its body becomes magnetized and it seems as though it has a cold. The [Magnemite] is no longer interested in [Pikachu]. [Magnemite] was in love with [Pikachu] because he was magnetized, but [Magnemite] has no interest in a non-magnetized electric mouse.
A [Gyarados] submarine comes out of the water with a large magnet attached to it. [Team Rocket]'s plan is to use the magnet to capture [Pikachu] due to the fact that his body is now magnetized. What they don't know is that [Pikachu] is no longer magnetized. When they activate the magnet, [Magnemite] and [Magneton] from all over town are sucked onto the magnet. The weight of all the [Magnemite] and [Magneton] cause the sub to sink.
As [Ash] and the others prepare to leave [[Gringey] City], they mention that the [Grimer] horde was a sign that the town needed to be cleaned up and suggest that if the residents clean up the air and water, they'll restore the city to its former glory. Taking the advice to heart, the residents bid farewell to the kids with hopes of a brighter and greener future.
Meanwhile, at [Professor [Oak]]'s lab, a [[Poké] Ball] arrives from [Ash]. As [Professor [Oak]] wonders what [Ash] caught this time, the [[Poké] Ball] opens up, and [Professor [Oak]] covers his nose in disgust as [Muk] appears.


[Ash] and his friends travel on a pathway through some mountains, as they figure out how to get to the [Fuchsia [Gym]]. [Brock] comments that [Fuchsia [Gym]] should be right over the mountain, but realizes that they are surrounded by many mountains. Elsewhere in the forest, [Team Rocket] is having a picnic and getting ready to eat their lunch. [Jessie] says that she is having Chinese food, [James] says that he's just having tea and crumpets, and [Meowth] says that he will have no food since he is getting a gut, and is working out. An explosion is heard as the screen shakes. [Ash], his friends, and [Team Rocket] all wonder where that explosion came from. [Team Rocket]'s food spilled all over them, as they are very upset that they didn't even get to eat their food. Everyone runs to where the explosion came from, as they see trucks drive by.
A large rock falls from the wall, as holes in the ground send all of the trucks crashing to the ground. Everyone looks shocked as they watch it happen. [Team Rocket] comments that it's a lot of destruction, but they didn't even cause it. [Pikachu] hears [Pokémon] saying [Diglett] over and over from underneath the ground. A [Diglett] pops out of the ground, as [Pikachu] greets it, and [Diglett] goes back underground. The foreman comes out of his truck and says that he can't take it anymore. [Ash] and his friends go to him, as he tells them to look at the [Diglett] in the distance. The [Diglett] are dropping in and out of the ground, as [Misty] comments that they are very cute. The foreman yells at [Misty], and says that the [Diglett] are preventing them from building a dam. [Ash] scans [Diglett] with his [Pokédex] which says that people can recognize their movement them from the upturned earth. [Ash] comments that he doesn't see any upturned earth. The foreman says that it is because the ground is covered with concrete, but if they look closely they can see the movement. [Misty] comments that it looks like a mini earthquake. The foreman says that they may not be able to achieve their dream of building the "Great Giva Dam." An explosion causes a large rock to fall from the wall. [Brock] asks the foreman if the blasting is a part of building the dam. The foreman says that it is a part of building the dam, and that they cannot get supplies through because of the [Diglett].
The foreman explains that they came up with a special division to come up with strategies to get rid of the [Diglett]. They are looking for any [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] to help them get rid of the [Diglett]. He is offering a reward of a six night, seven day stay at the Giva hot springs resort for anyone who can get rid of them. [Ash] tells him that they are able [[Pokémon] [Trainers]]. The foreman thinks that they were the ones called in, as [Gary] arrives with a few trucks behind him and says that the invited [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] have arrived. [Gary] notices [Ash], and says that it must be a coincidence that he is there since only the best [Trainers] such as himself were invited. [Gary] calls himself the best [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] and says that [Ash] is fourth. He says that [Ash] was the fourth to leave [Pallet Town] and is ranked last as a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]]. [Gary] asks [Ash] if he has caught any good [Pokémon] as [Ash] offers to show him, but [Gary] says no thanks and that only amateur [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] show off their [Pokémon].
[Gary] says that if he's going to show anything off, it would be his personal fan club. [Ash] asks if they are [Pokémon], as [Brock] hits him in the head and tells him to not be dumb. [Brock] asks who the girls are, and [Gary] explains that they are friends of his. [Brock] asks the girls if they want to go out with him some time, and they all respond by saying yes sir. [Misty] comments that [Brock] is over the hill. [Brock] asks the girls for phone numbers, addresses, or email addresses, while the foreman begs for someone to go after the [Diglett]. [Gary] and his girls drive off to stop the [Diglett]. [Brock] doesn't get their phone numbers, while [Ash] says that he can't let [Gary] beat him. [Team Rocket] comments that they are [[Pokémon] [Trainers]], and that if they win the stay at the resort, that they would love some rest and relaxation. [Meowth] makes a phone call and asks if he could be switched to a less embarrassing team, as a loud wind passes them by. A large rock breaks off from the wall of a cliff, as the foreman addresses the [[Pokémon] [Trainers]]. [Ash] comments that there are a lot of [Trainers], as the foreman yells to him to listen and not talk. [Ash] didn't like that he didn't call him by name. He calls himself the loser of [Pallet Town], and breaks down. [Brock] tells him not to get worked up about [Gary], and that he can still catch up to him. [Jessie] says that her name is [Jessie], with no one to hear her say it. [Team Rocket] calculates that there would be a lot of [Pokémon] that the [Trainers] have, that they could steal. They realize though that with only [Koffing] and [Ekans], they can't possibly take on all of their [Pokémon]. They look sad, as they try to figure out how to go after the [Trainers]' [Pokémon]. [Meowth] suggests a sneak attack, but they say that it always fails. They decide to go with plan B, which is the principle of induced evolution.
The foreman shows a large pull-down sheet that has a no-[Diglett] picture on it. He calls [Diglett] a great parasitic [Bug] [Pokémon], as [Gary] corrects him by saying that [Diglett] is called the mole [Pokémon], and at eight inches tall and two pounds, it cannot be called a great anything. [Ash] calls [Gary] a show off that thinks he knows everything. The foreman says that they may be small, but in large numbers can be very destructive. He sees the [Diglett] coming, as they take down a truck. [Gary] steps forward and says for everyone to watch the top [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] at work. His cheerleaders say that he doesn't dig the [Diglett], as he throws his [[Poké] Ball] to bring out a [Pokémon] to battle [Diglett]. The [Pokémon] refuses to come out of its [[Poké] Ball] as the [Diglett] brings the [[Poké] Ball] back to [Gary]. [Gary] thanks the [Diglett], but realizes that it wasn't supposed to happen that way. [Gary] throws another [[Poké] Ball] which contains his strongest [Pokémon]. The [Pokémon] does not come out of its [[Poké] Ball], prompting [Gary] to throw all of his [[Poké] Balls] as the foreman begs for someone to get rid of the [Diglett]. Everyone else throws all of their [[Poké] Balls], but all of the [Diglett] give them back to their [Trainers]. [Misty] comments that at least the [Diglett] are polite, as [Brock] adds that they are also unstoppable. 
[Ash] says that since they are underground, he will use his [Squirtle] to face the [Diglett]. [Pikachu] tries to stop [Ash], but he had already thrown the [[Poké] Ball]. [Squirtle] also refuses to come out of its [[Poké] Ball]. [Gary] says that none of the [Pokémon] will come out, and that for some reason they do not want to battle the [Diglett]. [Ash] asks [Pikachu] if that is what's going on, and [Pikachu] nods yes. The foreman tries to hit the [Diglett] with a hammer, but [Gary] says it won't work since the [Diglett] may not be super strong, but they are really fast. [Ash] says that [Gary] must have really been studying, as [Gary] replies that he has, unlike [Ash]. [Gary] says that since none of the [Pokémon] want to battle, there is no reason for them to stay unless they want to see the foreman continue to try to hit the [Diglett] with a hammer. [Gary] says that he needs to continue on his journey to become a [[Pokémon] Master], and drives away in the car. [Ash] says that he doesn't like him. [Brock] never was able to get the girls' phone numbers.
That night, [Ash] and his friends are taking a bath in some hot water outside. [Misty] says that she can't understand why the [Pokémon] wouldn't come out of their [[Poké] Balls]. [Ash] asks [Pikachu] why that is, and [Pikachu] points to where the [Diglett] are. [Ash] and friends follow them. While they are following the [Diglett], they pass by the foreman who keeps trying to hit the [Diglett] with a hammer. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is reading about how to evolve their [Pokémon], and find out that [Pokémon] must have a lot of experience before they can evolve. They say that [Pokémon] change when they evolve, and that they've known both [Koffing] and [Ekans] for a long time. They ask how can they evolve them as they hug the [Pokémon]. As [Team Rocket] hugs their [Pokémon] and cry, their tears touch both [Pokémon] as they turn white and begin to evolve. [Meowth] comments that their time to evolve is now. The evolved forms were not yet shown to the viewers at this stage. [Ash] and his friends continue to follow the [Diglett] that are bringing small trees to a mountain range just for [Diglett] and [Dugtrio].
[Ash] and his friends look on as they see [Dugtrio] dig around, and [Diglett] planting the trees. [Ash] scans [Dugtrio] with his [Pokédex]. [Brock] comments that it must be [Diglett] and [Dugtrio]'s home. He explains that they play and work together on that mountain range, with [Dugtrio] plowing through the ground, and [Diglett] planting the trees. He also explains that the whole mountain range was built by them, and that maybe more gardens, forests, and mountain ranges across the world were also built by [Diglett] and [Dugtrio]. The foreman comments that if they finish the dam, then the whole mountain range would get flooded and no [Pokémon] would be able to live there. They realize that the [Pokémon] figured that out before they did, and that's why they wouldn't come out of their [[Poké] Balls]. [Brock] comments that they have a lot to learn about the ways of the [Pokémon]. The foreman decides that they will stop their work on the dam, as [Diglett] and [Dugtrio] continue working in the garden.
[Team Rocket] shows up and does their motto as [Meowth] interrupts them by saying that they know the rest. [Ash] tells them that they are not in the mood to deal with them today. [Jessie] says that they are in a good enough mood to share with them a special treat. As they wear Japanese outfits, hold fans, and fireworks go off above, they begin to introduce their new [Pokémon]. [Jessie] introduces her new [Pokémon], as her [Ekans] has evolved into [Arbok]. [James] introduces his new [Pokémon], as his [Koffing] has evolved into [Weezing]. Music plays in the background, and fireworks go off, as [Team Rocket] prepares to attack. [Ash] brings out [Squirtle], [Charmander], and [Bulbasaur] to attack them. [Weezing] attacks with [Smog], and [Pikachu] uses [Thunderbolt] but [Arbok] dodges the attack. [Arbok] digs underground, while [Weezing] follows it. [Diglett] and [Dugtrio] say their name a few times, with [Team Rocket] saying it once. Underground the [Diglett] and [Dugtrio] are beating up [Arbok] and [Weezing], as they come out of the ground with bumps and are knocked out. [Diglett] and [Dugtrio] pop out of the ground, and form a tall group of them with mud. [Team Rocket] looks scared, as the group comes toward them. [Team Rocket] and their [Pokémon] ride on top of the [Diglett] and [Dugtrio] group and act as if they are surfing. [Team Rocket] sees the dam up ahead, and crash into it and hit the ground hard.
[Ash] and [Misty] comment that [Team Rocket] never do learn their lesson or catch a break. The foreman comments that he definitely learned his lesson. [Ash] comments that their stay wasn't a waste after all. [Brock] says that they are in luck, that Fuchsia City is just over the mountains. [Team Rocket] comes out of the ground, as a sign falls on their head. They read that the sign says that the dam project is cancelled and they are disappointed by that. [Ash] and his friends head off towards [Fuchsia [Gym]].


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are trekking through a forest looking for [Fuchsia [Gym]], when they decide to take a break at a lake. They sit by a lake with [Pikachu], [Vulpix] and [Psyduck]. [Misty] tells [Psyduck] that drinking cold water will only make its headache worse. [Brock] mentions how wonderful [Vulpix]'s hair is thanks to [Suzie], causing [Misty] to get annoyed and ask if [Brock] wants to trade [Vulpix] for [Psyduck]. However, he refuses. As they head off for the [Gym], a [Venonat] watches them from the trees.
As [Ash] and his friends continue walking, they end up at an odd-looking mansion where they stop to ask directions. They end up at an old house and open the door to find an empty corridor. [Misty] leans against a wall and falls through it. The others search the wall and eventually open it up to find her. There, they see the same [Venonat] that was spying on them before. It hops away, so they decide to follow it. It runs around a corner, and when they run after it, [Ash] hits his face on an invisible wall. They turn around to leave, only to hit another wall. [Ash] then falls out of the side of the house and is hanging on. The others manage to pull him up, and [Ash] starts to go through the door. [Misty] and [Brock] hear him yell, and go through the door to find an empty room. They call for [Ash], and the door closes behind them to reveal him stuck to a wall with throwing stars. Then a girl who identifies herself as [Aya] falls down onto them. [Aya] says that she will not let them go until [Ash] and her have a battle. He accepts, and she sends out [Venonat]. [Ash] chooses [Bulbasaur]. [Bulbasaur] uses [Tackle] but [Venonat] jumps out of the way. [Venonat] then launches a [Stun [Spore]] attack, which [Bulbasaur] deflects with [Whirlwind]. [Bulbasaur] then finishes it off with [Leech Seed]. [Aya] returns [Venonat] and a [Voltorb] appears and selfdestructs. [Koga] appears, and explains that they are at the [Fuchsia [Gym]], and that he is the [[Gym] Leader]. He says [Aya] is his sister and that he will battle [Ash], and not let them go until he does.
[Ash] sends in [Pidgeotto], and [Koga] responds by sending out his own [Venonat]. Having just defeated [Aya]'s [Venonat], [Ash] is noticeably confident. However, [Koga] warns [Ash] that his [Venonat] has a lot more experience. As if to drive the point home, [Venonat] chooses that moment to evolve into [Venomoth]. The battle begins. [Koga] orders [Venomoth] to use [Stun [Spore]]. [Ash] responds to this the same way he did in his battle against [Aya], by ordering [Pidgeotto] to use [Whirlwind]. This time, however, [Stun [Spore]] wins out and paralyzes [Pidgeotto]. [Venomoth] then follows up with [[Sleep] Powder], prompting [Ash] to recall [Pidgeotto] and send out [Charmander]. [Venomoth] uses [Stun [Spore]] again, but [Charmander] blocks it with [Flamethrower]. At that point, [Team Rocket] arrives and send out [Arbok] and [Weezing]. [Ash], [Aya], and [Koga] send in [Charmander], [Venonat], and [Venomoth] respectively to battle, but [James] throws a fistful of a sticky substance at them, immobilizing them. [Pikachu] then steps up, only to meet the same fate from [Jessie]. [Koga] then pulls a cord, opening up panels in the ceiling, and unleashing a large amount of [Voltorb] on the trio. However, [Team Rocket] uses more of their sticky goop to reel in the entire pack of [Voltorb]. [Misty] then tries to send out [Starmie], but [Psyduck] chooses that moment to break out of its [[Poké] Ball]. [Misty], seething with rage, asks [Ash] what moves [Psyduck] knows. [Ash] consults the [Pokédex], which lists [Tail Whip]. [Misty] tells [Psyduck] to use [Tail Whip]; [Psyduck] wags its tail to no effect whatsoever (aside from making [Misty] more angry). The [Pokédex] then lists [Psyduck]'s second move as [Scratch]. On [Misty]'s order, [Psyduck] uses [Scratch] on [Arbok]. Not only does this not work, [Arbok] begins biting [Psyduck]'s head, worsening its headache. At that moment, [Psyduck] amazes everyone by using a variety of psychic powers to freeze [Team Rocket], blast them off, and remove the sticky gunk from [Venonat], [Venomoth], [Charmander], and [Pikachu]. [Ash]'s [Pokédex] chimes in, listing [Psyduck]'s third and fourth attacks; [Disable] and [Confusion]. [Koga] and [Aya] both offer to trade for [Psyduck] but [Misty] declines, saying "I wouldn't trade [Psyduck] for the world." [Ash] and [Koga] continue their battle outside. [Ash] chooses [Charmander] and [Koga] chooses [Golbat]. [Charmander] defeats [Golbat] with [Ember] and [[Fire] Spin], and [Koga] gives [Ash] a [Soul [Badge]], and the trio go on their way.


As [Ash] and his friends near the [Safari Zone], they come across a ranch, where they see a herd of [Tauros]. Wanting to catch one (believing they are in the [Safari Zone]), [Ash] tries to have [Pikachu] face down the stampede, but [Pikachu] refuses because he is massively outnumbered. When [Ash] sends out [Charmander], it is immediately pinned by a [Growlithe]. After a brief trade of [Flamethrowers] by the two [Fire] [Pokémon], [Ash] and friends are introduced to [Lara Laramie], of the Laramie Ranch, a ranch that preserves and raises wild [Pokémon]. [Brock] immediately recognizes the name, as it is said that [Pokémon] bred by the Laramie clan are of superior breeding. After [Ash] realizes that they are not in the [Safari Zone], Lara invites them to a local festival, as a [Pokémon] race will be held the next day. Lara intends to race with her [Ponyta], a [Pokémon] whose mane will burn anyone it does not trust. When [Ash] tries to touch [Ponyta], his hand is burned, and he has [Squirtle] put out the flames. Lara's main opposition is [Dario], a [Dodrio] [Trainer]. Lara explains that the winning team of [Pokémon] and [Trainer] will be named as an honorary member of the Laramie clan.
At the festival, while many are cheering Lara on, [Dario] arrives to tell Lara that her [Tauros] have suddenly begun attacking each other over a bout of confusion. After they arrive on the scene, Lara tells [Growlithe] to tame the [Tauros], but during all this [Ponyta] is spooked, causing Lara to be thrown off, injuring her arm. As [Ash] tries to rein in [Ponyta], the audience learns that [Team Rocket] is behind spooking the [Tauros] and incapacitating Lara, at the request of [Dario]: [Dario] intends to win the competition by any means necessary, while [Team Rocket] seeks to make money from the Laramie fortune.
With her injured arm, Lara would not be able to ride [Ponyta], but after seeing [Ash] try to rein in [Ponyta], she tries to convince [Ash] to take her place. At first, neither [Ash] nor [Ponyta] feel right about it ([Ponyta] showing its reluctance by burning [Ash] again), but Lara insists that both stand to gain from winning ([Ash] from his [Trainer] skills, [Ponyta] from its upbringing). [Ash] and [Ponyta] use the entire night to prepare for the race.
At the race, many pairs have entered: along with local farmhands and their [Pokémon], [Dario] and [Dodrio], [Ash] and [Ponyta], [Brock] and [Onix], [Misty] and [Starmie], as well as the all-[Pokémon] team of [Pikachu] and [Squirtle] (representing [Ash]'s entry), all enter the race. When the race starts, [Dario] and [Dodrio] quickly take the lead, while [Pikachu] and [Squirtle] quickly fall to the back of the pack , though they do eventually catch up. At the same time, [Team Rocket] has already begun eliminating the opposition - two well-aimed slingshot shots manage to spook a [Tauros], and he runs into a [Nidorina], and they take their frustrations out on each other. After a sprint comes a steep uphill portion, where [Pikachu] is forced to push [Squirtle] up the hill, putting them far behind once again. Then, the racers come upon a downhill section where another violent accident occurs: an [Electrode] and its [Trainer] roll down the hill uncontrollably, and a pitfall trap dug up by [Team Rocket] manages to take out the [Electrode] and its [Trainer] as they were rolling downhill with increasing speed. This gives [Dario] a significant lead, while [Electrode]'s [Explosion] attack manages to incapacitate a [Sandslash], [Raticate], but most importantly [Ash] and [Ponyta]. [Ash] and [Ponyta], however, are able to continue, thanks to [Pikachu]'s [ThunderShock] and the fact that the two [Pokémon] were still lagging far behind.
Farther up ahead is a stepping-stone portion, which [Dario] and [Dodrio] cross with ease. However, this does not bode well for the two closest chasers: [Brock] and a farmhand with his [Rhyhorn] - when [Rhyhorn] attempts to jump on a stone, it sinks. This forces both out of the race (as [Brock], with the largest [Pokémon] in the race, couldn't cross due to [Onix]'s fear of water). This leaves only four teams still racing: while [Ash] and [Ponyta] navigate the stones, [Starmie] and [Squirtle] swim across the water easily. At the next portion, teams must make a stop and allow their [Pokémon] to eat an entire plate of [Pokémon] food before sprinting to the finish. [Dario] and [Dodrio] are the first to arrive, but the other racers catch up due to [Dodrio]'s three heads fighting over who gets to eat first. Desperate to eliminate the other three teams, [Dario] is forced to use [Team Rocket]'s assistance once more (from which [Ash] and [Misty] learn of [Dario]'s alliance with [Team Rocket]). [Ash] tells [Pikachu] and [Squirtle] (who had both been scarfing down [Pokémon] food during [Team Rocket]'s motto) to take care of [Team Rocket], but [Arbok]'s [Glare] paralyzes them, while [Starmie] is blinded by [Weezing]'s [Sludge]. This allows [Dario] enough time to take off towards the finish.
As [Misty] implores [Ash] and [Ponyta] to keep going (leaving [Team Rocket] to herself and the three [Pokémon]), [Team Rocket] causes [Ponyta] to literally get fired up, shocking [Arbok]. [Weezing] tries to attack [Ponyta] despite [James] telling it not to use gas, but [Ponyta]'s flames ignite [Weezing]'s [Smog], and it explodes, sending [Team Rocket] flying. Now desperate to make up ground, [Ash] and [Ponyta] race towards the finish line. When [Ash] and [Ponyta] catch up, [Dario] then orders one of [Dodrio]'s heads to [Peck] [Ponyta], slowing it down. Everyone is then startled when [Ponyta] evolves through sheer will to win into the much-faster [Rapidash], and soon [Ash] and [Rapidash] manages to overtake [Dario] and claim the victory in a photo finish. Believing that he had been cheated, [Dario] orders [Dodrio] to attack [Rapidash], but is sent flying by a kick from its powerful hooves.
As the festivities wrap up, [Ash] and friends bid farewell to the Laramie Ranch, and continue on their way to the [Safari Zone]. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is seen in a nearby forest, tied to a tree by [Dario], who blames them for his loss. The episode ends on the trio being pecked repeatedly by [Dodrio] after [Meowth] insults it.


The episode begins with [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] thinking that they are in the [Safari Zone], and [Ash] spots a [Chansey] in a bush. He gets ready to throw a [[Poké] Ball]; however, the [Chansey] turns out to be [Ranger Jenny] in a [Chansey] hat. She points a rifle at [Ash] then arrests him for [Pokémon] poaching. She takes the group back to the station and explains that they are in a [Pokémon] Preservation Area where it's illegal to catch [Pokémon].
[Ash] tells [Officer Jenny] he didn't know, so Jenny lets them off with a warning. Almost immediately, she sees a red dot on her radar, signaling that there are more poachers; [Ash] offers for him and the group to help. Jenny accepts, and the whole group travels to the location by the jeep that she drove them to the station in. They drive up to find [Team Rocket] trying to capture a group of [Kangaskhan]. [Ash] looks at his [Pokédex], which says the [Kangaskhan] charge when in danger until they feel their young are safe. [Team Rocket] fires a rocket and scares all the [Kangaskhan], making them charge towards the jeep. The group manages to escape, but [Team Rocket] traps all the [Kangaskhan] in a net.
[Jessie] throws a [[Poké] Ball], but it is hit by a boomerang and sent flying back at her. Suddenly, a kid begins to yell, cutting the net and setting the [Kangaskhan] free. The [Kangaskhan] attack [Team Rocket], blasting them off.
The kid jumps into the pouch of the biggest [Kangaskhan]. A helicopter soon lands and two adults come out, saying they heard a report of their missing child in the area. They all go back to the station and they hear that Tommy, or Tomo, is living in the area. [Ash], [Brock], [Misty], and [Pikachu] leave the jeep and go look around for the infant [Kangaskhan] that should be in the pouch Tommy was riding in. They manage to find it, and give it a [Super [Potion]] since it is injured.
The kid sees the infant in pain when the [Potion] stings its wound slightly, thinks they are hurting the infant [Kangaskhan], and he jumps down. He then asks [Misty], "You people or [Pokémon]?" [Misty] punches him and says that they are people. The two adults who earlier claimed to be Tommy's parents run over and talk to Tommy thinking he will remember them. He doesn't at first and claims the [Kangaskhan] are his family. His father smacks Tommy with a piece of wood to start from scratch. He remembers his mom, but not his father. His father opens his shirt and [Misty] smacks the father with a piece of wood, saying, "One memory at a time!" Jenny rushes back because her radar shows more poachers, and Tommy runs to the [Kangaskhan] to help.
They find a giant robot [Kangaskhan] made by [Team Rocket]. It pretends to be injured to persuade the other [Kangaskhan] to go help it, but their leader tries to stop them because she senses something amiss. However, they ignore their leader and go to help the "injured" robot anyway so, the trap works, and they are all hit by tranquilizers and fall asleep. The leader goes to take revenge on [Team Rocket] but is hit as well.
[Ash] then brings out his [Pokémon]: [Bulbasaur] and it uses [Vine Whip] and [Squirtle] tries [Skull Bash], but neither of them work. [Team Rocket] powers up for an attack, but the [Kangaskhan] break free. [Pikachu] and [Charmander] use [ThunderShock] and [Flamethrower]. When Tommy throws his boomerang, it hits the fuel tank cover knocking the gasoline out, and [Charmander]'s fire sets it ablaze. Though the robot is on fire, it doesn't slow it down.
Suddenly, the helicopter comes in and crashes into the mechanical [Kangaskhan]. It explodes, and [Team Rocket] "blasts off again". Tommy thinks his parents are dead and begins to cry, but they get up. They are revealed to be wearing similar things as Tommy and they say they will join Tommy, much to Tommy's delight.
The episode ends with Tommy, his parents, and the infant [Kangaskhan] in the leader's pouch waving goodbye as [Ash] and his friends are leaving.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are touring the area in the [Safari Zone]. [Ash] is singing, while the narrator explains that the group hasn't yet caught a single [Pokémon], but with so many [Pokémon] in this area, it's understandable why anyone would want to sing.
As the group approaches a building, [Ash] sings that they're in the [Safari Zone]. [Brock] asks [Ash] to stop singing, but [Ash] ignores him and continues to sing. [Brock] asks [Misty] to help him stop [Ash], and she replies by singing along with [Ash]. [Pikachu] sings along, and [Brock] gives in and decides to sing as well. Just then, a man approaches from the building and demands they "shut up!" [Ash] asks what the man's problem is, to which the man pulls out a firearm and asks whether he wants to get shot. The group hastily apologizes, and the man relents. He then introduces himself as [Kaiser], the [Safari Zone] warden.
Inside the building, [Kaiser] shows the group a basket of [Safari Balls] and a fishing rod. [Ash] is delighted and reaches out eagerly for them, but [Kaiser] pulls his gun out and explains the rules of the [Safari Zone]: all that's permitted to be used are the [Safari Balls] and fishing rod. If they break the rules, his "[Thunderbolt]" will burn them. He then points the gun at [Ash]'s head to demonstrate his point.
[Misty] notices a picture of [Kaiser] as a young man, in which he's holding a [Dratini]. As [Ash] and [Misty] view the picture, [Brock] tells them that he's heard rumors of a [Dratini] living in this [Safari Zone], and the picture certainly proves that the rumor is true. Before this can be expanded on any further, [Kaiser] leaps forward and snatches the picture from [Misty]'s hand, screaming that there is no [Dratini]. [Ash] argues otherwise, but seeing [Kaiser] reach for his gun is more than enough to make him take his statement back. [Kaiser] leaves the group, taking the picture with him. [Misty] wonders why he acts so serious, to which [Brock] replies that something must be up for him to act like this. [Ash] suggests that they ask [Professor [Oak]], which the rest agree on.
The focus then shifts on [Kaiser], who is standing outside the building staring at the picture. He apologizes to [Dratini] and says that he will never bother it again. Meanwhile, [Professor [Oak]] explains to the kids that he knows [Kaiser] well. Thirty years ago, a [Dratini] was found in the [Safari Zone] by [Kaiser] himself. [Trainers] from all over flocked to the [Safari Zone] to catch [Dratini], but while they were there, they caught many other [Pokémon] in the process, literally destroying the [Safari Zone]. Since then, only the use of [Safari Balls] has been allowed in the [Safari Zone]. The [Dratini] was never found; all that remains is a picture. [Team Rocket], overhearing the conversation, decides to catch [Dratini] and all of the other [Pokémon] in the [Safari Zone].
With [Safari Balls] and fishing rods in hand, [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are about to enter the [Safari Zone]. Just then, [Team Rocket] appears on top of the entrance gate and recites their motto. Before they can finish, however, [Kaiser] takes out two firearms and starts shooting at their feet. [Team Rocket] falls to the ground and proposes a challenge: whichever group catches more [Pokémon] will win. If [Ash] and his friends win, [Team Rocket] won't bother the group ever again. If [Team Rocket] wins, they will take all of the group's [Pokémon]. [Ash] accepts the challenge, confident that he will win.
The first [Pokémon] that [Ash] and his friends see are a herd of [Tauros]. [Ash] and [Brock] catch two of them easily with [Safari Balls]. The group then hides behind bushes while observing a [Rhyhorn]. [Ash] throws a Safari Ball at the [Rhyhorn], but just then, the herd of [Tauros] run past, causing [Ash] to end up catching another [Tauros]. [Jessie] observes the group from afar, commenting on how [Team Rocket] will end up getting all of the [Pokémon] anyways. It turns out that [Team Rocket] is inside the entrance building, with [James] holding a firearm to [Kaiser]'s head. [Jessie] holds another firearm to [Kaiser]'s head while asking him to tell them where [Dratini] is. [Kaiser] resists, causing [Jessie] to send out [Arbok] to wrap itself around him. After several unsuccessful attempts at getting [Kaiser] to tell them where [Dratini] is, [Team Rocket] sends out a mecha that tickles [Kaiser], causing him to finally concede.
Meanwhile, [Misty] shows off her special lure to the group. She takes out one modeled after herself and throws it into the lake. Soon after, she gets a bite from a [Gyarados], but the line breaks, causing the [Gyarados] to go back into the lake. [Kaiser] appears before them, still being tickled by the mecha, and asks them to help get it off of him. [Pikachu] uses [Thunderbolt], effectively stopping the machine. [Kaiser] reveals that [Team Rocket] is going after [Dratini], who is in the Dragon Valley.
[Team Rocket] is at a lake inhabited by [Dratini]. [James] and [Meowth] don scuba gear and attempt to find [Dratini], while [Jessie] is waiting for them above. Suddenly, a [Dratini] emerges from the water and reveals itself to [Jessie]. She kneels down on the pipe that is supplying air to [James] and [Meowth], calling the [Dratini] to come closer while the other two struggle for a breath of air. Just as [Jessie] tries to grab it, [James] and [Meowth] splash out of the water, scaring it away. [Jessie] starts to yell at them, when [Meowth] reveals a backup plan to capture all the [Pokémon] in the lake. He explains how the electric bomb he is holding will zap all the [Pokémon] in the water and cause them to rise to the surface.
Just then, [Ash], [Misty], [Brock], and [Kaiser] intervene. [Jessie] asks whether [Ash] has caught any [Pokémon], to which he answers that he has used up all of the [Safari Balls], meaning that he wins. [Jessie] says that the game isn't over yet and throws in the bomb. [Kaiser] jumps in the lake after it. [Ash] starts to jump after him, but [Misty] stops [Ash], telling him not to go. [Ash] says that he will be okay and dives into the lake. [Misty] sends out her [Staryu] to help out [Ash] and [Kaiser]. [Ash] and [Staryu] catch up to [Kaiser], and [Ash] has [Staryu] take [Kaiser] back to the surface. [Ash] reaches the bottom, retrieves the bomb, and starts to go back up, but then runs out of air.
Suddenly, a storm begins and a giant whirlpool forms in the lake. A [Dragonair] emerges from the center with [Ash] on its back, and the skies clear up. [Ash] throws the bomb back at [Team Rocket] just as the timer sets off, causing [Team Rocket] to blast off. [Ash] returns to the group and [Dragonair] approaches [Kaiser]. [Kaiser] realizes that [Dragonair] is the same [Dratini] that he took care of all those years ago. A [Dratini] appears next to [Dragonair], and [Kaiser] realizes that this [Dratini] is [Dragonair]'s child. Both [Kaiser] and [Dragonair] are moved to tears by their reunion after so many years.
Back at the building, [Ash] promises [Professor [Oak]] that the group will tell no one that they saw a [Dratini] or [Dragonair] in the [Safari Zone]. [Professor [Oak]] says that the group has grown up well and asks [Ash] if he has sent him any new [Pokémon], to which he says yes. Just then, a herd of [Tauros] trample over the Professor in a stampede, revealing that in the end, [Ash] failed to catch anything but [Tauros]. The episode ends as [Ash] and his friends bid farewell to [Kaiser], with [Dratini] and [Dragonair] watching over them.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] came across a bridge during their travels. They wanted to walk on it but an officer named Norman said only the bike track was ready, not the actual road. Devastated, the group then attempted to get a bike but was unsuccessful. When they arrived at the [[Pokémon] Center] to think of a plan to get a bike, they found a worried [Nurse Joy]. She said she had to deliver medicine for injured [Pokémon] over the bridge to [Sunnytown], but she could not leave the center because she had [Pokémon] to attend to. [Ash] and [Misty] agreed enthusiastically. As they rode joyfully across the bridge, [James], [Jessie] and [Meowth] sailed slowly below the bridge. [Jessie] made plans.
Just after [Ash] and his group finished their refreshments, a strange group of wild bikers came. They tried to escape but were surrounded. The leader of the gang, [Chopper], challenged [Ash] to a battle. He sent out [Golem] and [Ash] sent out [Bulbasaur]. [Golem] easily defeated it with a single [Tackle]. [Ash] then sent out [Charmander]. [Charmander] set [Golem] on fire with a [Flamethrower] and an [Ember]. [Golem] tackled [Charmander] but ended up setting fire to three of the gang's members. [Chopper] withdrew his [Golem] but the [[Poké] Ball] was still hot from [Charmander]'s attack.
Next, [Tyra], the other leader of the bike gang, sent out [Cloyster]. [Misty] wanted to battle and tried to send out [Starmie] but [Psyduck] appeared. [Misty] decided to give it a chance, which got [Tyra] laughing her head off. [Psyduck] was clueless and the bike gang cracked up in laughter. [Psyduck] used [Tail Whip] and again, the bike gang laughed at it. After a few rounds of this humiliation, [Team Rocket] arrived and said their motto. But it appeared that [Team Rocket] were heroes in the bike gang's view. [Jessie] was called "Chain Jess" because she used to swing a chain around as she rode her bike. [James] was called "Little Jim" because he was the only one in the group who had used training wheels. Just as [Team Rocket] and the bike gang attacked [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock], the police arrived. The bike gang immediately rode off, almost leaving [Team Rocket] behind. When [Officer Jenny] arrived, she offered them a ride but then said she had a job to do. The weather got ferocious and turned into a storm. Meanwhile, [Chopper] and [Tyra] challenged [Team Rocket] to ride through the storm on their unicycles.
In [Sunnytown], [Nurse Joy] was worried that medicine wasn't arriving to cure the injured [Pokémon], a [Shellder].
Then, a ship passed by and the bridge lifted up but [Ash] was determined to save the sick [Pokémon], for it would have been too late if they had stopped for the bridge to go back down. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] are trying their hardest to pedal their unicycles up the other side of the upturned bridge. Just as [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are not going to make it, they saw [Team Rocket] jumping off the other side and bounced on their heads, sending [Team Rocket] into the water while allowing them to be propelled upward and on to the other side. As they passed the bike gang, they challenged [Ash] to a battle. [Ash], of course, refused and told them he's delivering medicine for a sick [Pokémon]. The bike gang realized now why they were riding through the storm and joined them. [Nurse Joy] in [Sunnytown] was relieved when the bike gang and [Ash] arrived with the medicine. The bike gang's new heroes were "Awesome [Ash]" and "Mighty [Misty]". Then, [Brock] tells [Tyra] that she can call him "Honey", only to receive a large, red slap across his face.


[Ash] and his friends are continuing their journey when it begins to rain. While looking for shelter, they stumble across an old house in the middle of nowhere. Believing it to be deserted, they go inside. To their surprise, [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] is found playing with what seems to be another [Pikachu]. However, this [Pikachu]'s face is weird, which leads to [Brock] thinking it is a new kind of [Pikachu]. [Ash] tries to capture it, but a girl dressed as [Ash] appears and stops him. The girl introduces herself as [Duplica] and reveals that the [Pikachu] is actually her [Ditto]. Upon reading [Ditto]'s entry in the [Pokédex] and hearing that it can't learn any other attacks besides [Transform], [Ash] becomes unconvinced of its usefulness in a battle, so [Duplica] challenges him to a battle. [Ash] chooses [Bulbasaur] and tries to attack using [Razor Leaf], but [[Duplica]'s [Ditto]] [Transforms] and wins using a [Vine Whip] attack.
Later, [Duplica] explains that she wants to be a [Ditto] Master and a star, but she cannot because her [Ditto] is unable to mirror other [Pokémon]'s faces. Whenever it transforms it still has the face of a [Ditto], much to the disappointment of her audiences. Then [Team Rocket] appear and try to steal [Ditto], in the hope that they can get it to transform into [Dratini] and present it to their boss as a [Legendary [Pokémon]]. Using [Weezing]'s [SmokeScreen], they are able to escape with [Ditto].
Once they are away from the house, [Jessie] and [James] try to test [Ditto]'s power by having it turn into a [Dratini] from a picture in a book that they have, at first. But then, [Jessie] stops [James] and says that they should have a little bit of fun before handing [Ditto] over to the boss. She asks [Ditto] to transform into what a certain boy would look like if he were an adult, and pulls out a photo frame. [James] and [Meowth] then try to get [Jessie] to show the picture to them, but she refuses. [Ditto] agrees, and then a picture of a man with blue hair shows up with a [Ditto]'s face which even licks [Jessie] on her face. [James] and [Meowth] laugh out loud over the picture and the licking movement, which [Jessie] responded angrily by slapping them unconscious. Now angry, [Jessie] commands [Ditto] to once again become a [Dratini]; she points to the picture of the [Pokémon] in the book. Instead, [Ditto] transforms into a book, which even aggravates [Jessie] further.
Meanwhile, back at the mansion, [Misty], [Brock], and [Ash] are trying to cheer [Duplica] up. [Ash] then states about how a [Trainer] decides how a [Ditto] would transform. [Pidgeotto] and [Zubat], who were on guard, return with news that they saw [Ditto]. [Ash] and friends then decide to go and save [Ditto].
[Team Rocket], still trying to get the [Ditto] to transform correctly, try to get it to change into [Meowth]. They then yell at [Ditto] because its face doesn't look like [Meowth]'s after it transformed. They are angered when it is unable to change its face from its own. Eventually, they are able to threaten it into transforming correctly.
[Team Rocket] is happy that [Ditto] can now transform correctly, and [Meowth] then asks [Ditto] to transform into [Dratini], but they are then interrupted by [Ash]'s voice. When [Jessie] and [James] hear this and turn around, spotlights appear over [Ash], [Brock], [Misty] and [Duplica], dressed in [Team Rocket] uniforms. The four of them then say their variation of the [Team Rocket]'s motto, much to the irritation of the real [Team Rocket]. [Misty] notes it was great to do the whole thing and [Ash] notes he had figured out that the reason why [Team Rocket] say their motto a lot was because it's fun. [Duplica] suggests they should all become actors and when they have a good laugh at this, [Jessie] and [James] become even more angry at this. [Jessie] states that their organization is not something to be made fun of, and also tells them that if they are going to imitate them, they should do it right. [James] then states to [Duplica] she got one part of the motto wrong. The group demands [Ditto] back, but they are surprised when they see two identical [Meowth]. However, [Duplica] is happy that [Team Rocket] was able to get her [Ditto] to transform correctly. [Team Rocket] try to trick them by giving them the real [Meowth] and escaping in their balloon with [Ditto]. But [Duplica] says she can tell that [Meowth] isn't her [Ditto], even though it looks identical to the other [Meowth]. She throws [Meowth] at the balloon, causing [Team Rocket] to drop [Ditto]. [Duplica] tells it to transform into a cannon and fire [Pikachu] at the balloon. After being hit by [Pikachu]'s [ThunderShock], the balloon bursts and [Team Rocket] are blasted off again.
Now that [Ditto] can transform perfectly, [Duplica] reopens her theater for performances. She thanks [Ash] and his friends and they leave, with [Ash] hoping to catch his own [Ditto] someday.
The episode ends with [Team Rocket] attempting to put a [Dratini] suit onto [Meowth], who scratches them.


The episode begins with [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] going to the nearest [[Pokémon] Center] in [[Matcha] City] in order to revive [Ash]'s tired [Pikachu] when they see a distressed [Nurse Joy]. There's a problem with the [[Poké] Ball] transporter — the [Pokémon] she sends never arrives at another [[Pokémon] Center], and it's replaced by a different [Pokémon]!
[Dr. [Akihabara]], the inventor of the [Pokémon] Transport System, is at the Center trying to figure out what went wrong with the system. [Brock] suggests that a computer virus could be the source of the problem. [Akihabara] explains that the system couldn't have been infected with a virus because he designed the circuits so well. [Ash] confuses his explanation of a computer virus with a biological one and thinks the transport system is actually sick. [Nurse Joy] is told about an anti-virus vaccine, which is a powerful software made to fix the problem. However, upon further investigation into the system, [Akihabara] unexpectedly gasps and suddenly bolts out of the Center, leaving Joy and the others confused.
[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] break into [Akihabara]'s huge laboratory mansion to figure out what happened to him. Inside, they are startled by a giant holographic image of [Akihabara]'s head. After realizing [Akihabara] is still friendly, [Ash] and his friends are lead into a room with a giant machine. The doctor orders them to enter the machine, only telling them that they have entered a giant Human Transporter after he has sealed and locked the door. It is at that time that [Porygon] appears in the midst of them. [Akihabara] introduces [Porygon] to the group and explains that some thieves, namely [Team Rocket], have stolen his other prototype [Porygon], and are causing havoc. [Team Rocket] is literally inside the system, blocking the [[Poké] Balls] from reaching the [[Pokémon] Centers] and keeping them for themselves. [Akihabara] can't send the anti-virus vaccine in there because humans are inside the computer, and the vaccine would surely blow them to pieces. So, [Akihabara]'s solution is to send [Ash] and friends into the machine with [Porygon] to defeat [Team Rocket]. [Ash] and his friends refuse, but [Akihabara] traps them inside the Human Transporter and they are eventually sucked into cyberspace.
The group falls into the Transporter system, but [Porygon] flies beneath them, grows in size, and catches them. Riding on [Porygon]'s back, [Ash], [Misty], [Brock] and [Pikachu] ride over to [Team Rocket]'s location.
[Team Rocket] are celebrating their so-far successful raid of [Pokémon], confident since they are where no human has ever gone before. Just as [Team Rocket] claims that no one can catch them, [Porygon] floats into view, infuriating [Meowth]. [Jessie] and [James] send out [Arbok] and [Weezing] into a battle. [Weezing] uses [Poison Gas] on them, making [Ash] and friends cough. Then [Porygon] regains composure and uses [Conversion]. [Porygon]'s skin color becomes purple, like [Weezing]'s. [Porygon] charges, with the group still riding it, right into [Weezing] and [Arbok], effectively knocking them out.
[Jessie] decides to send their prototype [Porygon] out next, which looks similar to [Akihabara]'s [Porygon], except that it bears a "R" flag on its tail and a zero on its forehead. [Jessie]'s [Porygon] uses [Sharpen] to give itself a sword-like beak and tries to attack the other [Porygon], who has also changed shape to counter it. [Ash] and his friends decide to capitalize on the distraction to move the barrier [Team Rocket] built to hold back all the [[Poké] Balls] that were intended to be delivered to the [[Pokémon] Centers]. Team's Rocket's attempt to stop them were stopped by [Pikachu]'s [[Thunder] Shock]. Then, [Akihabara]'s [Porygon] sent [Team Rocket] and the prototype [Porygon] "blasting off again".
[Ash] and friends weren't out of the woods yet. [Akihabara], represented by a floating TV screen, tells them that trouble is afoot again. [Nurse Joy] has hired another technician to put the anti-virus vaccine program into the computer, and it indiscriminately targets [Team Rocket] and [Ash] and his friends. Trying to fix the problem himself, the doctor did not tell [Nurse Joy] that the problem was caused by real people and not a virus. As the Vaccine targets the heroes, [Porygon] gathers [Ash] and his friends and attempts to escape. From the ground, [Team Rocket] call [Ash] out for running away, but are corrected by [Ash] when he tells them to run from the Vaccine. The Vaccine launches a few rockets that destroy the remainder of the [[Poké] Ball] barrier in sparkly, flashing red and blue explosions. [Meowth] and the prototype [Porygon] rescue a panicking [Jessie] and [James] from the moving sea of [[Poké] Balls] and join [Akihabara]'s [Porygon] in an attempt to escape.

  Scene after [Pikachu] blew up the missile. For health and safety reasons, please click on the image to view the animation.
The vaccine transforms into an object that resembles a flying spaceship, looking like a cross between a [Star Wars] [X-wing] and a medical needle, and takes pursuit. It launches more missiles that both of the [Porygon] dodge with difficulty. Inside the Center, [Nurse Joy] and the technician are amazed by the resilience of the "virus" and command the Vaccine to unleash a powerful attack. Revealing a gigantic particle gun, it locks onto the prototype [Porygon] and fires a huge beam, sending [Team Rocket] downward into a cyberspace bug hole created by the powerful attack. The passengers of [Akihabara]'s [Porygon] shield their eyes from the blinding red and blue light. The bug holes created by the vaccine's beam cause a system error, and Joy orders the technician not to use the attack again.
[Team Rocket] awakens at the bottom of one of the bug pits, and realize that their [Porygon] is knocked out and that they cannot escape. The flying Vaccine locks onto them again, and it seems that it's all over for [Team Rocket] if it wasn't for a last minute save by [Bulbasaur]'s [Vine Whip]. Held onto [Akihabara]'s [Porygon] by [Bulbasaur], [Team Rocket] weighs [Porygon] down and slows down its progress toward the exit portal. The vaccine locks onto [Akihabara]'s [Porygon], and fires four more missiles. [Porygon] is tired and cannot dodge the missiles. [Pikachu] steps in and launches a destructive electric attack, detonating two of the missiles in a huge red and blue flashing explosion that covers the entire screen. It buys [Porygon] just enough time for it to escape through the exit portal as the next two missiles hit the portal itself, destroying [Akihabara]'s entire house, much to [Akihabara]'s dismay, as his Human Transporter is now in pieces.
In the remains of the mansion, [Ash] and friends are relieved to be back in the real world. [Team Rocket] spitefully thank [Ash] for saving them, and then quickly exit, forgetting their prototype [Porygon].
The heroes decide to check in on the [[Pokémon] Center]. [Nurse Joy] is relieved to see the Transport system working again, oblivious to the fact that [Ash] and friends risked their lives to fix the system. In the end, however, [Ash], [Brock], and [Misty] decide not to tell [Nurse Joy] of the ordeal.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] were resting in the forest. [Ash] started to swing on vines, but he slammed into a tree. [Pikachu] came over to see if [Ash] was all right when he saw a small [Pikachu]. [Ash] and [Pikachu] ran after it and [Misty] and [Brock] followed them, only to see a whole clan of [Pikachu] with the small [Pikachu] in a clearing. [Pikachu] said hello but the wild [Pikachu] got scared and ran off. [Pikachu] started to walk away, but the small [Pikachu] came over and shook tails with him. [Brock] claimed it must have accepted [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]]. [Ash] ran toward them, yelling that he wants to be part of their group, but he scared them and they ran off.
Later, [Ash] asks [Brock] and [Misty] why the [Pikachu] ran away. [Brock] tells him that he probably scared the [Pikachu], because they were not used to human contact in the deep forest they were in. The small [Pikachu], watching their conversation, fell into a river and [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] jumped in to save it. The [Pikachu] all started joining tails to save them and they succeeded.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] saw the [Pikachu] and decided that they would capture all of them for their [Boss].
At night, all of the [Pikachu] started singing their [Pikachu] chant. [Ash] and his friends watched and saw how happy [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] was. [Ash] was sad, but when asked what was wrong claimed it was nothing. He stayed up while [Misty] and [Brock] slept and saw [Pikachu]'s face in the fire. He thought maybe [Pikachu] should be with his own kind. The fire finally went out, with the image of [Pikachu] running away. Suddenly, the [Pikachu] screamed for help. [Ash], [Brock], and [Misty] went to investigate the noise immediately, only to find all the [Pikachu] captured in a net which was, as [Jessie] said, electric-proof. [James] shot a net at [Ash] and his friends, but they got out of it very easily. [Team Rocket] started sailing away with the [Pikachu] but [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] began chewing at the net and broke it. [Ash] and his friends held up the net they were captured in and the [Pikachu] jumped into it unharmed. [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] bit a hole in the balloon and [Team Rocket] started "blasting off again". [Ash] started to walk away without [Pikachu] and [Misty] and [Brock] asked him why. He said [Pikachu] would be happier here. [Pikachu] started following but [Ash] yelled at him to stay behind. He ran away and remembered a lot about [Pikachu], having a flashback of many memories of their previous adventures.
Finally, [Ash] stopped and [Misty] and [Brock] caught up to him. Behind [Ash], his [Pikachu] shook tails with the small [Pikachu] and all the wild [Pikachu] started chanting. [Pikachu] ran into [Ash]'s arms. [Ash] was so touched that he started to cry. The episode ended with [Ash] and [Pikachu] hugging, with the narrator saying that in their hearts, they know that they will face every challenge together.


On their way to [Cinnabar Island] for the seventh [Gym] battle, [Ash] and his friends are walking through a forest when [Pikachu] hears a [Pokémon]'s cry. It leads the group towards the cry and shows them that inside of the base of a tree is an [Eevee] tied to a post. After scanning [Eevee] with his [Pokédex], [Ash] wants to catch it since it may be abandoned, but [Misty] notices [Eevee] has a name tag and address on it saying that its trainer lives in [Stone Town]. [Brock] says to them that [Stone Town] is at the foot of [[Evolution] Mountain], which contains evolution stones that allow certain [Pokémon] to evolve. On their way to [Stone Town], [Ash] looks in his [Pokédex] for more information on [Eevee], and it mentions Eeeve's evolutions via evolution stones: [Jolteon], [Flareon], and [Vaporeon]. The group finds that the address leads them to a giant mansion.
As they arrive in the backyard, the heroes notice that there is a garden party being held. They see that almost all of the [Pokémon] at the party are ones that evolve with evolution stones. They even get the chance to see many of the said stones out on display. Meanwhile, up on top of a hill, unbeknownst to everyone, [Team Rocket] sees all of the evolved [Pokémon] and hear about the stones, and also crave for the food.
The three brothers who are hosting the party, [Sparky], Rainer, and Pyro, see [Ash] and his friends with [Eevee], and says that that [Eevee] is the star of the party. They call for their youngest brother, Mikey, who is [Eevee]'s trainer. The brothers, who each own one of the [Eevee] stone evolutions, mention that the only way to win battles is for Mikey to evolve his [Pokémon]. Mikey says that he doesn't care about battles, which makes his brothers and their [Pokémon] mad, and they push Mikey even harder about which of the [Eevee] evolutions is stronger. [Brock] comments that the family sure is competitive, especially when they try to push [Ash] to evolve [Pikachu] and [Brock] to evolve [Vulpix].
As [Misty] watches her [Horsea] swim around in the fountain, she looks over to see Mikey on the bench with a drink, and offers some food to him, telling him not to let his brothers push him around. [Misty] asks if he really wants to evolve [Eevee], and Mikey explains that his brothers only care about battling, so he hid his [Eevee] just for today so that nobody could make him evolve it. [Misty] tells him that he was just running away from his problems, and that it is his responsibility as a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] to tell his brothers that he doesn't want [Eevee] to evolve. [Pikachu] plays with [Eevee], and [Misty] mentions how he once had the chance to evolve and chose not to.
Mikey's brothers come up and ask Mikey if he has made his decision yet. [Misty] tells Mikey just to go right out and tell his brothers what he has wanted to say. As Mikey is about to tell his brothers what he has decided, sparks on the ground go off by everyone. [Team Rocket] arrives in their balloon and does their motto while eating all of the party food. [Weezing] then uses [SmokeScreen] over everyone. [Ash] brings out [Pidgeotto] to use [Gust] to blow the [SmokeScreen] away. Once the smoke clears, everyone realizes that all the [Pokémon] (except [[Misty]'s [Psyduck]], much to her annoyance), the evolution stones, and the food are all missing.
[Brock] notices that they are getting away in their balloon, and [Ash] has [Pidgeotto] stop it. The balloon crashes, but it turns out to be a decoy when it turns up empty. [Pidgeotto] goes to search for [Team Rocket]. As [Team Rocket] are walking down the road with the [Pokémon] in cages, [Horsea] leaves a trail of ink so that everyone will know where they are headed to. [Pidgeotto] sees the ink on the ground.
At the lake with the trapped [Pokémon], [Team Rocket] has a picnic with the food that they stole. They realize that they need to decide what to evolve [Eevee] into. They soon get to arguing about it, until [Jessie] blows a whistle and says that they should use all evolution stones at once. They go to evolve [Eevee], when [Ash] has [Squirtle] use [[Water] Gun] to stop them. Before it can attack, [Psyduck] appears in front of [Squirtle] and tries a [[Water] Gun] but fails. [Team Rocket] says that is embarrassing, as [Misty] agrees and returns [Psyduck] to its [[Poké] Ball].
[Squirtle] uses [[Water] Gun] on [James] and [Meowth], which sends them backwards, and [Jessie] tells them to stop as she picks up [Eevee]'s cage. She brings out [Arbok], while [James] brings out [Weezing] to attack [Misty]. [Misty] and [Ash] prepare to battle with their [Pokémon], but the [Eevee] Brothers stop them and say that they must be the ones to battle, since it is their brother's [Eevee] that was stolen.
The brothers get ready to attack with [Vaporeon], [Jolteon], and [Flareon]. [Arbok] uses [Poison Sting], while [Jolteon] counters with [Pin Missile] which hits [Arbok]. [Weezing] uses [Sludge], but [Vaporeon] enters the water and uses [[Acid] Armor] to go invisible to avoid the attack. [Weezing]'s attack misses as [Vaporeon] jumps out of the water and uses [Tackle] to send [Weezing] to the ground on top of [James]. [Team Rocket] tries to run away, but [Flareon] uses [[Fire] Spin] to stop them. The brothers demand that [Team Rocket] give back the stolen [Pokémon], but [Jessie] has [Arbok] use [Tackle] on [Jolteon], while [Weezing] uses [Sludge] on [Flareon] and [Vaporeon]. [Horsea] spits out ink into [Jessie]'s face which sends [Eevee] flying and it lands in Mikey's arms. [Pikachu] uses [Thunderbolt] on [Team Rocket], but they keep going.
As Mikey pulls [Eevee] out of the cage, he looks over and notices that his brothers' [Pokémon] are severely hurt. [Team Rocket] decides that it's time to finish them off. Mikey stands up and decides that he and [Eevee] are going to have their first battle. Mikey commands [Eevee] to use [Take Down], and then has [Eevee] turn it into a rage [Tackle]. [Eevee] sends [Team Rocket] blasting off with the attack. Mikey jumps for joy and picks up [Eevee] after winning, while [Eevee] licks him to show affection. Mikey's brothers congratulate him on his first win, and Mikey tells them that he just wanted to help everybody out. He also tells his brothers that he wants to become an [Eevee] [Trainer]. The [Eevee] brothers accept his decision, and [Sparky] says that they should turn the party into a celebration of Mikey's first victory.
As they cheer with drink glasses, everyone congratulates Mikey on his first battle victory. Mikey thanks [Misty] for helping him, gives her a flower, and they shake pinky fingers and promise to be friends forever. Everyone at the party then gathers for a picture. [Psyduck] clicks a button to take the picture, but falls as the camera takes the shot.
Meanwhile, later in the night, [Team Rocket] is eating food that isn't as fancy. [Jessie] says that they will be champions of the world, as they all say "some day".


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are heading for another town, with [Pikachu] fast asleep. They run into a hippie, who plays a song on his [[Poké] Flute] (which wakes up [Pikachu]). He then asks them for food, but they don't have any, so they continue on their way. Then the hippie says, "Oh, well. Another free concert." Shortly after, [Team Rocket] arrives, and are rude toward the hippie when he plays them a song and asks them for food. After they walk away, he mentions that they should learn to respect their elders.
[Ash] and company reach the town, only to find that there is no food, as there are no ingredients for cooking any food. The mayor of the town gives them food and tells them that the village is unable to get any food because the river has dried up, killing all the produce. So, [Ash] and his friends head upstream to check it out. They run into thorns, and [Misty] gets cut by one of them. With the help of [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]] and its [Razor Leaf], they get through the thorns to find that the flow of the river is being blocked by a [Snorlax], which is very big and weighs close to 1000 pounds.
[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] try to wake [Snorlax] up. [Ash] even attempts to capture the [Pokémon], but the [[Poké] Ball] just bounces right off of [Snorlax]'s belly. Soon after, [Team Rocket] arrives. [Team Rocket] tries to steal [Snorlax], which [Ash] and his friends try to help them with, as it will unblock the flow of the river. However, their attempt to steal [Snorlax] by attaching cables to their hot-air balloon doesn't work, so they decide to try to wake up [Snorlax] once again. After an alarm clock and a bucket of water prove unsuccessful, they decide to try the [Sleeping Beauty] approach, and get a [Pokémon] to kiss [Snorlax]. [Misty] tries to have [Horsea] kiss [Snorlax] (because it is the "most noble" of all their [Pokémon]), but [Psyduck] releases itself from its [[Poké] Ball] and kisses it instead. [Team Rocket] forces [Meowth] to kiss [Snorlax], but even this doesn't wake it up, even though [Snorlax] seemed to flinch when this happened.
[Snorlax] then rolls over, revealing a card that tells them that only the beautiful music from a [[Poké] Flute] will awaken a [Snorlax]. They remember the hippie had a [Pokémon] flute, and run over to him to ask him to wake up [Snorlax]. However, [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] get into an argument with [Team Rocket], and eventually [Jessie] tries to attack with [Arbok], but a [Gust] attack from [Pidgeotto] sends them "blasting off again".
[Ash] and his friends take the hippie to the [Snorlax]. As it turns out, the hippie owns the [Snorlax]. He wakes [Snorlax] up with his [[Poké] Flute], but the river is still blocked. The real source of the blockage is more thorns, but the thorns turn out to be [Snorlax]'s favorite snack item. The hungry [Pokémon] eats all of the thorns, successfully unplugging the river and ultimately saving the town.
After eating enough food, [Snorlax] goes back to sleep again. [Team Rocket] soon realizes that they won't be able to steal [Snorlax], and then [Snorlax] rolls over on top of them.


[Ash] and his friends arrive in [Dark City], a place where it appears to be a ghost town, much to [Brock]'s dismay. They are even more curious to see a parent herding their child off for fear of [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] in the area. As [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] ponder why that is, [Pikachu] is hit by a rock thrown from the roof of a nearby building. When [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to retaliate using a [Thunderbolt], they hit three kids on the rooftop. When they go apologize to them, however, they get a cold shoulder treatment, as the kids want the group out of the town. The kids, however, are stopped by a local restaurant owner, who invites them to his restaurant.
At the restaurant, while eating lunch ([Pikachu], in particular, taking a liking to eating ketchup from the bottle), the restaurant owner explains to [Ash] and his friends, as well as a mysterious patron who had happened to overhear, that [Dark City] has two rival [[Pokémon] [Gyms]], the Yas [Gym] and the Kaz [Gym]. Both [Gyms] seek official status, but to do so they would need the approval of the [[Pokémon] League] inspector, who is scheduled to arrive at any moment. As there could be only one official [Gym] per city, each [Gym] seeks to eliminate the other before the inspector arrives. The restaurant owner further explains that [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] who have neared [Dark City] are recruited for the cause of either [Gym]. At that moment, fighting between the two [Gyms] breaks out. As [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] watch from the safety of the restaurant, the three note that the fighting is not as much of a [Pokémon] battle as it was a gang war. The Yas [Gym]'s [Scyther] and the Kaz [Gym]'s [Electabuzz] in particular are dispatching the men of the opposing [Gym] with ease.
At that point, the safety of the restaurant is shattered when [Team Rocket], hired by the Kaz [Gym] as elite bodyguards, invades the restaurant in disguise and demand food. When they send out [Arbok] and [Weezing] to deal with the restaurant owner when he refuses (because of the Kaz [Gym] having run up a large tab), [Ash] (with [Pikachu]) and [Misty] (with [Starmie]) attempt to intercept [Team Rocket], but are beaten by [Brock], whose [Vulpix] quickly forces [Team Rocket] out of the restaurant with a [Flamethrower]. [Vulpix] has now garnered the attention of a female Yas [Gym] recruiter, who tries to recruit [Ash] and company for their cause. At the advice of [Misty] (who claims that taking sides would ruin their reputations as [Trainers]), [Ash] introduces himself as Tom Ato, [Misty] as Ann Chovy, and [Brock] as Caesar Salad, who, because [Brock] could never say no to a beautiful girl, takes them to the Yas [Gym].
The Yas Leader is introduced to "Tom" and his two "disciples", who proceeds to judge how powerful he is by suddenly releasing his [Scyther] to attack [Pikachu]. The [Scyther]'s [Cut] attack, however, is blocked by [Pikachu]'s ketchup bottle. This resulted in [Scyther] getting squirted in the eyes with ketchup, blinding it and making it attack its own [Trainer]. Surprised, the Yas Leader recalls [Scyther] and asks [Ash] to join him. When asked why the Yas [Gym] wanted to be an official [Gym], the Yas Leader responds that it is simply a means to earn money quickly, as with official [Gym] status comes prestige and funding. Because [Ash] does not see this as a worthy cause, he declines. However, the Yas Leader, mad at [Ash] for refusing, orders his underlings to physically beat him up (making him unable to help anyone else), and they do so by sending out a [Hitmonchan], [Hitmonlee], [Machoke], and [Mankey] to do so. [Ash], aided by [Misty] and [Brock], proceed to make a hasty retreat. Back at the restaurant, [Misty] is curious as to why he was able to escape the Yas [Gym] so quickly - and uncovers the answer from [Ash]'s [Pokédex]: [Scyther] and [Electabuzz] are color-sensitive, and the color red in particular will send the two into an outrage. Knowing this, [Ash] and company devise a plan to stop the fighting once and for all by defeating both the Yas and Kaz forces in one fell swoop.
Once again, fighting breaks out on the streets of [Dark City] between the Yas and Kaz forces. [Scyther], using a [Swords Dance] boosted [Cut], manages to destroy Kaz forces and city buildings with ease, while [Electabuzz] and [ThunderPunch] manages to do the same against the Yas forces. When [Ash] sees an opening, he tells [Misty], [Brock], the restaurant owner, and the kids to dump tomato juice (stored in barrels on the roofs of various buildings) on all the [Trainers], soaking them. This makes [Scyther] and [Electabuzz] go into a rage, and they begin to attack their own [Trainers]. Yas and Kaz, the two leaders, are at [Ash]'s mercy, and [Ash] decides to end this by having [Bulbasaur] [Vine Whip] two barrels of tomato juice on [Scyther] and [Electabuzz], soaking both. When the two turn to attack each other (due to the rage), they run into each other, knocking the two out.
When [Ash] asks whether the two Leaders have learned their lesson and resolved their differences, the two leaders finally agree... to team up and deal with [Ash]. In response, [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to unleash [Thunder], shocking both sides. Before any more damage can be done, however, the mysterious patron appears. The patron reveals herself to be [Nurse Joy], the [[Pokémon] League] inspector (and [Brock] blushes once again upon seeing her), and tells everyone that neither Yas nor Kaz deserved to be an official [Gym] because street fighting would not be tolerated. However, [Nurse Joy] allows the two Leaders a second chance, and tells the two that [Ash] would make a fine tutor with regards to how to be a proper [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] and how to start over as one united [Gym], but even "Tom Ato" is at a loss of words with regards to how to be one. However, [Ash] does manage to tell the two Leaders to repair all the damage to the city that they had caused.
As [Ash], [Misty], [Brock], and [Pikachu] leave [Dark City], they are met again by the kids from in town. They had quickly became fans of [Pikachu] and, because of such, decide to become [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] themselves. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket], having been covered in juice just as a building falls on them during the battle, are run out of town by [Scyther] and [Electabuzz] in their red-induced rage.


[Ash] and his friends find themselves in a town on the same day as a carnival. Excited to party, [Brock] and [Ash] change into funny outfits and start dancing. [Misty] and [Pikachu], embarrassed, walk away, go on some rides, and eat some ice cream. Soon after, [Misty] notices a woman shouting at a man with an [Exeggcute]. The woman shouts something about a payment the man owes her, shoves him back into a box, and walks away. [Misty] asks the man if everything is alright and he asks her if she'll be his assistant for his magic show, since his previous assistant just quit. He introduces himself as [Melvin] and conjures some flowers and flags. [Misty] agrees to help him, but just for the day.
[Misty] is forced to wear a leotard adorned with [Goldeen] fins and is embarrassed, but, luckily, only four people showed up to the show. Unfortunately, [Ash] and [Brock] arrive and [Ash] laughs at her while she is on stage. [Melvin] then starts to juggle his [Exeggcute] and everyone, even [Misty], thinks it's boring. [Melvin] then pulls out a wand and a tiny flame comes out; the crowd falls back and makes exclamations like "That was pathetic!" He tries again, and a huge jet of flame comes out. [Misty] tells him to be careful, but he's so thrilled the trick actually worked that he doesn't listen to her and the fire sprinkler system in the building activates, drenching the audience. The carnival manager fired [Melvin] because of the stunt and wants to give up all his dreams, but [Ash] and co. promise to give him some tips.
[Ash] performs his own trick involving a "magic" box with fire and water "magically" shooting out of the top, but it really just contains [Charmander], [Squirtle], and [Bulbasaur]. The three [Pokémon] get into a fight inside the box and subsequently ruin [Ash]'s trick. [Ash] says that [Melvin]'s [Exeggcute] doesn't do much, so it uses [Hypnosis] on him. [Brock] and [Misty] wonder why [Ash] is acting so dopey, especially after he follows [Melvin]'s command and spins in circles while acting like a [Bulbasaur]. After [Melvin] realizes how he can control [Ash], he and [Ash] sneak away from [Brock], [Misty], and [Pikachu].
[Melvin] then commands [Ash] to pull him into the [Leaf Forest]. [Team Rocket] sees [Melvin] and [Ash] and starts to follow them. [Brock] and [Misty] are out looking for [Melvin] and [Ash] when [Misty] then realizes that [Ash] is being hypnotized. The [Leaf Forest] is full of [Exeggutor], which [Melvin] has [Ash] weaken; [Melvin] then catches the entire mob of [Pokémon]. [Team Rocket] makes an entry and says their motto, then ties [Melvin] up. His [Exeggcute] evolves into an [Exeggutor] without warning, and then uses [Hypnosis] on [Team Rocket]. The other [Exeggutor] copy this and end up hypnotizing each other, causing them to go on a rampage toward the town. [Jessie], [James], and [Meowth] are hypnotized into believing they are [Exeggutor], and follow the heard. [Brock] and [Misty] show up and wake up [Ash] and [Melvin], who were trampled by the marching [Exeggutor]. [Ash] is no longer hypnotized.
The four of them head for town, where they see that the carnival has been almost entirely destroyed, and discover the [Exeggutor] mob is turning around and coming back their way. The carnival owner tells them he's planted a time bomb so that when the [Exeggutor] come back, they'll be blown up. [Ash], [Brock], and [Misty] are of course opposed to this, so they decide to try to stop the [Exeggutor] before they reach the bomb. [Ash] sends out [Squirtle], [Bulbasaur], and [Charmander] in an attempt to stop the heard. [Squirtle] and [Bulbasaur]'s attacks don't have much of an effect. [Ash] calls those two back into their [[Poké] Balls], and orders [Charmander] to attack. The Lizard [Pokémon]'s fire attacks successfully stop some of the [Exeggutor]. It quickly becomes exhausted, however, and the [Exeggutor] keep charging forward. [Misty] tries to convince [Melvin] to use his fire trick to stop the [Exeggutor], and, although he's positive he'll fail, he tries anyway. The trick ends up working, and together with [Charmander], they stop the [Exeggutor]. [Melvin]'s [Exeggutor] returns to him, resulting in [Melvin] running up to it and giving it a hug. The time bomb then goes off just a distance away, destroying the carnival, and, to their relief, no one gets hurt from the blast. Suddenly, [Charmander] evolves into [Charmeleon] and shoots a flame at [Ash]'s face, its loyalty to [Ash] now in question. [Team Rocket] gets carried away by the [Exeggutor], and the gang continues on their journey.


[Ash] and his friends arrive in [[Mossgreen] Village], a village so small it doesn't have its own [[Pokémon] [Gym]]. Because of this, [Ash] feels that there's no reason to stop there. However, [Brock] reveals that their bag of [Potions] and [Antidotes] is empty, so they should stock up on supplies in town. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket], hot on their trail, is about to make their move on [Pikachu]. Before they get far, however, they discover [Meowth] has fallen ill. Deciding that the loss of [Meowth] is worth the capture of [Pikachu], [Jessie] and [James] begin to leave him behind; they are immediately scolded by a girl, who lashes out at them for abandoning their [Pokémon] (believing that [Jessie] and [James] were [Meowth]'s [Trainers]). She then nurses [Meowth] back to health and, during this process, [Meowth] has fallen for the girl.
In town, the group arrives at an herbal shop to purchase their medicine. Entering, they find an old woman grinding herbs. When they request to buy some [Potions] and [Antidotes], she offers them snake root that will cure insomnia and grow hair on their nose and tongue. The old woman is then scolded by the same girl who helped [Meowth], her granddaughter, named [Cassandra]. [Brock] immediately falls for her, trying to make small talk about how he intends to be the best breeder, but [Cassandra] parlays the conversation into a [Pokémon] battle, which [Ash] accepts. At the battle, [Cassandra] sends out her [Paras], while [Pikachu] leads off for [Ash]. However, before the battle, [Pikachu] tries to make friendly talk (in a show of sportsmanship), but it causes [Paras] to cower in fear. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is spying on the battle, intent on stealing [Pikachu]; [Meowth] is distracted by [Cassandra], as he intends to repay her for healing him.
Meanwhile, [Cassandra] admits her ulterior motive in battling: she wants to make this [Paras] evolve so that she could use [Parasect]'s mushroom to help develop a miracle [Pokémon] medicine. [Paras] is acting cowardly, fearful of battling. Agreeing to "throw the battle" by going easy on [Paras], the battle gets off to a rocky start when [Pikachu] fires a small "static bolt" at [Paras], which unfortunately knocks it out. While [Cassandra] tries to get [Paras] back into shape, [Misty] suggests [Ash] try a different [Pokémon]. As [Paras] is both a [[Bug]-type] and a [[Grass]-type], [Ash] decides to send out [Squirtle], for which [Paras] would be at an advantage. However, that does not go too well either, as [Squirtle]'s weakened [[Water] Gun], meant to just "sprinkle [Paras]' mushrooms a little", also manages to knock it out. Desperate to help [Paras] evolve, [Ash] sends out [Charmeleon], despite the massive advantage it has, telling it to go easy on [Paras]. [Charmeleon] refuses to obey, gets too violent, and instead of doing an easy, soft attack, it launched a full-power [Flamethrower] at [Paras] before sending it flying by smacking it with its tail. This causes [Paras] to run away. When [Ash] tries to rein in [Charmeleon], he too, is blasted in the face. [Pikachu] decides to hit [Charmeleon] with a [Thunderbolt], enabling [Ash] to recall it. [Ash] can't believe [Charmeleon] is acting this way, as he was so excited when [Charmander] evolved, but apparently [Ash] wasn't ready for it. [Misty] tells [Ash] to deal with the problem with [Charmeleon] later and that they need to find [Paras].
As [Paras] is running away, it bumps into [Meowth], wanting to help [Cassandra], tries to get [Jessie] and [James] to help [Paras]. However, they want to know what's in it for them. [Meowth] then explains that if [Paras] evolves, [Cassandra] will be able to make her miracle [Potion] which would be worth millions. [Meowth] then explains that once they help [Cassandra], she'll make [Meowth] their company mascot. [Jessie] and [James] don't see where this would benefit them, but then [Meowth] explains that he would make them his business managers as he'll probably have a lot of money to manage. Fueled by greed, [Jessie] and [James] agree, asking [Meowth] how they'll make their millions. [Meowth] then explains that he needs [Arbok] and [Weezing] as "losing battles is their specialty". First, [Arbok] goes off against [Paras], but before [Arbok] can go full-power on it, [Meowth] intercepts the attack, knocking [Arbok] down. [Paras], believing it had defeated [Arbok], is cheered by [Jessie] and [James] as if it had scored the knockout. This repeats itself with [Weezing] and with [Meowth], causing [Paras] to get fired up.
[Cassandra], with [Ash] and company in tow, manage to find [Paras] up a tree, and because of its visibly different mood, determine that it's raring to go. While [Team Rocket] is watching from a nearby bush (in the hopes that [Ash] would help them on their objective), [Ash] sends out [Pikachu] to battle again. [Paras] goads [Pikachu] closer and manages to prod him in the tail. As [Pikachu] prepares to retaliate from the cheap shot, he is reminded by [Ash] to throw the fight, so instead [Pikachu] falls over, feigning unconsciousness. [Ash] then sends out [Charmeleon] for another chance, but once again [Charmeleon] starts to disobey. [Ash] can't understand this as it was always obedient before evolving. The old lady, [Cassandra]'s grandmother, then explains that if the [Pokémon]'s strength is greater than the [Trainer]'s skill level, it won't respect him and take orders. [Cassandra] asks that [Ash] call back [Charmeleon], but it breathes fire on him again before turning towards [Paras], who finds itself cowering in fear again. [Team Rocket] then comes out of hiding and cheers [Paras] on to win, only to be burned by [Charmeleon]. [Charmeleon] advances on [Paras] and is about to finish it off when [Paras], in desperation, closes its eyes and throws out its pincer, which strikes [Charmeleon] in the stomach, causing it to collapse. [Paras] is surprised that it won. Soon after, [Paras] begins to evolve into [Parasect]. Everyone hails [Parasect]'s success, including [Team Rocket] who feel they're about to board the "gravy train". [Charmeleon], however, recovers and angrily sends [Team Rocket] flying by smacking them with its tail. It then turns back to [Parasect] for revenge. [Cassandra] attempts to protect it, but [Parasect] stops [Charmeleon] with its [Spore] attack, putting it to sleep and allowing [Ash] to recall it.
As [Ash] and his friends leave, they are thanked by [Cassandra] for their help. [Ash] is also reminded by [Cassandra]'s grandmother that he'll never get control of [Charmeleon] if he doesn't improve his skill level. After the group leaves, [Team Rocket] drops in, and [Meowth] is nursed back to health once again. [Cassandra] is reluctant to let [Meowth] become the company mascot, not wanting to separate [Meowth] from the "heroic" [Team Rocket]. [Meowth] does not win the spot anyways, thanks to [Cassandra]'s grandmother having found a [Persian] for the company mascot instead. As [Team Rocket] sulks off, their potential riches lost, [Cassandra] promises to treat the [Persian] like it was [Meowth].


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are walking through a desert, looking for a place to sleep. By the time they arrive at a town by the name of [Neon Town], it's already dark. In the city, a mean looking guy bumps into [Ash] and gets mad at the boy. [Ash] retorts, but [Brock] immediately advises [Ash] to apologize; [Ash] refuses to do so. Before the situation gets more heated, [Officer Jenny] steps in and stops them. [Misty] notices that this Jenny is a bit cranky.
[Team Rocket] shows up in town where [James] bumps into the same guy [Ash] had encountered earlier. He gets mad at the guy, but [James] ends up getting punched repeatedly over the head. Meanwhile, [Jessie] is getting spanked by a large woman for bumping into her.
The next morning, as [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] come out of a hotel, they notice several people arguing with one another; the group decides to leave the town and all of the chaos. They head to a forest outside the city and spot a [Jigglypuff]. [Misty] expresses her desire to catch one. She calls out [Staryu], but [Psyduck] pops out instead. [Misty] scolds it and puts it back into the [[Poké] Ball], much to her dismay. After that, she sends out [Staryu] and it uses [Double-Edge] on [Jigglypuff]. The little pink round [Pokémon] gets upset and cries. [Brock] finds this [Jigglypuff] strange. The gang then find out that this [Jigglypuff] has a problem with singing. [Misty] apologizes for attacking it earlier and hugs the [Pokémon]; she then decides that they should teach it to sing. [Ash] agrees.
Hiding and spying on the gang, [Team Rocket] decides they want to use the [Jigglypuff] to put the people of [Neon Town] to sleep. They reveal themselves to the gang wearing costumes and proceed to sing a tune radically different from their motto. After they finish, [Ash] sends out his [Bulbasaur] to battle; [James] sends out his [Weezing]. [Bulbasaur], using its [Vine Whip], spins [Weezing] around in circles, resulting in [Weezing]'s [Poison Gas] attack to backfire on [Team Rocket]. [Misty] calls her [Staryu] and orders it to blast [Team Rocket] away using [[Water] Gun].
After dealing with [Team Rocket], [Misty] gives [Jigglypuff] some lessons on breath control when singing. [Ash] compliments her for having a good singing voice. [Pikachu] sings as well. When [Ash] compliments him, [Jigglypuff] gets annoyed and secretly kicks [Pikachu]. [Misty] inflates a balloon and puts it in [Jigglypuff]'s mouth. The air inside inflates inside and [Jigglypuff] goes flying. [Brock] helps [Jigglypuff] by giving it a fruit that can help make its throat feel better. [Jigglypuff] takes a bite out of the fruit and starts singing. [Pikachu] starts celebrating, but [Jigglypuff] kicks him again, this time out of joy.
[Misty] requests for [Jigglypuff] to sing. [Jigglypuff] obliges and starts singing beautifully. [Team Rocket], hiding behind some bushes, sets up the recorder to capture [Jigglypuff]'s voice. As [Jigglypuff] sings, everyone falls asleep. When [Jigglypuff] notices everyone sleeping, it gets upset. It goes through [Ash]'s backpack, pulls out a black marker, and scribbles markings all over their faces. It also finds [Team Rocket] sleeping and tries waking them up with [DoubleSlap]. Unable to wake them up, [Jigglypuff] scribbles on their faces as well.
[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] wake up only to find their faces covered with markings. They rub it off and see that [Jigglypuff] is mad at them. [Misty] realizes that they must have fallen asleep during the performance and apologizes to [Jigglypuff]. Everyone tries to cheer it up by letting their [Pokémon] listen to its singing. However, all of their [Pokémon] also fall asleep, [Misty] gets an idea of letting [Psyduck] listen to it since [Psyduck] is so dumb it wouldn't know if it was awake or asleep. After [Jigglypuff] sings for [Psyduck], [Jigglypuff] is still angry. [Misty] pokes [Psyduck] and it falls over revealing that it was asleep with its eyes open. [Misty] yelled at it for sleeping with its eyes open.
[Team Rocket] finally wakes up and see their faces are covered with markings, as well. They rub it off and proceed to check the recording. Unfortunately, the recorder did not capture [Jigglypuff]'s singing; it recorded their loud snoring instead.
[Brock] suggests an idea of letting [Jigglypuff] perform for the people in [Neon Town], which [Team Rocket] is happy to hear. When they get into town, the gang looks for a place for [Jigglypuff] to sing. A stage truck then pulls over; [Jessie] and [James], disguised as rock stars, offer them their stage.
With the stage set, [Jigglypuff] starts singing. The voice is so strong that everyone in the town starts falling asleep. [Team Rocket], whose ears were not closed properly, fall asleep as well. [Jigglypuff] gets really upset with all of them and goes to scribble markings on everyone's faces within the town. When the townspeople wake up, they seem friendlier to one another. The guy who bumped into [Ash] earlier even apologizes to him. [Misty] looks for [Jigglypuff] and realizes it was gone. [Team Rocket] awakens and leaves the city looking very happy, and in a good mood.
As [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] leave the city, unbeknownst to them, [Jigglypuff] follows close behind.


[Ash] and his friends are walking in an area called [[Grampa] Canyon] when they see a large group of people walking with picks and shovels. [Gary] appears and explains that he and the group are here for the [Fossil] Rush, because of a great '[Pokémon] Discovery'. [Ash] resolves to join in, so as to embarrass [Gary] by finding a [Fossil] before he does. [Jigglypuff] also appears, ready to sing, but the group leaves without noticing it.
[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] soon find a large area of the canyon where many people, including [Gary], are digging. However, they also stumble across [Team Rocket], who reveal (accidentally) their plan to blow up the canyon and steal all the [Fossils]. As [Meowth] lights the fuse, [Ash] runs up to [Team Rocket], and sends out [Squirtle] in an attempt to put the flame out. [Squirtle], [Pikachu] and [Ash] chase the fuse, trying to put it out; [Jessie], [James], and [Meowth] (along with [Arbok] and [Weezing]) try to stop him. [Team Rocket] then fall and start rolling, resulting in a ball of people and [Pokémon] rolling into [Ash], landing right beside the dynamite. As the fuse draws near to the dynamite, [Pikachu] panics and uses [ThunderShock], causing the dynamite to detonate. [Ash], [Pikachu], [Jessie], [James], [Meowth], [Arbok], and [Weezing] are now trapped in an underground cave, and only [Squirtle] escapes from the rubble. Hearing the explosion, [Misty] and [Brock] run to the pile of rubble and start digging out rock and soil with [Squirtle].
In the cave, [Ash], [Pikachu], [Team Rocket], and their [Pokémon] begin arguing over whose fault it is that they're down there. The group is soon confronted by [Fossil] [Pokémon] that they do not recognize. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex], and the [Pokémon] are revealed to be [Omanyte], [Omastar], [Kabuto], and [Kabutops]. [Jessie] and [James] begin to speculate that the explosion must have awakened them from thousands of years of sleep. Regardless, [Team Rocket] begin to contemplate stealing the [Pokémon] for their boss, and attempt to catch them by throwing [[Poké] Balls] at the [Fossil] [Pokémon]. A [Kabutops] blocks the balls, and they are rebounded at [Meowth]. All of the [Fossil] [Pokémon] start approaching the group to attack, so [Ash] sends out his [Charmeleon], but it refuses to help. A chase scene ensues, where the [Fossil] [Pokémon] are winning the chase. Then, all of a sudden, the [Pokémon] run away deeper into the cave. Originally confused, the group soon realize why the [Pokémon] ran off: an [Aerodactyl] swoops in, knocking over [Charmeleon]. Angry, [Charmeleon] tries to attack the [Aerodactyl], but is knocked out before it gets a chance. [Aerodactyl] then grabs onto [Ash] with its claws, and begins to fly towards the surface. Before the flying [Pokémon] can get too far, [Pikachu] and [Charmeleon] jump on board.
Back above ground, [[Brock]'s [Geodude]] had finally dug a hole through the rubble. The [Aerodactyl] flies out of the hole in the ground, dropping [Pikachu] and [Charmeleon] on its way out, and perches on a cliff with [Ash] still in hand. [Charmeleon] wants to battle the [Aerodactyl] as [Aerodactyl] had earlier annoyed him, but the [Aerodactyl] just taunts it. The anger this causes [Charmeleon] seems to make it evolve into [Charizard]. [Ash] is happy as he thinks that [Charmeleon] has evolved to rescue him, but then realizes he merely wants to battle [Aerodactyl] for his own pride and has no thought of rescuing [Ash].
Meanwhile, [Misty] sees [Jigglypuff] and tells it to sing its slumber song to make [Aerodactyl] fall asleep. [Jigglypuff] agrees and quite happily sings, of course sending everyone in the canyon to sleep. [Aerodactyl], now asleep, falls into the rubble, dropping [Ash] before falling. However, [Charizard] manages to stay awake by covering its ears and catches the sleeping [Ash] before he hits the ground, but falls asleep anyway once landing on the ground. [Ash] rolls off [Charizard], landing next to a [[Pokémon] [Egg]]. [Jigglypuff], seeing everyone has fallen asleep, draws markings all over everyone's faces with its marker out of anger. After awakening, [Officer Jenny] announces that the whole thing was a dream caused by [Jigglypuff]'s song, although [Ash] knows it wasn't.
As [Ash] and the gang leave, [Ash] takes the [Egg] out of his backpack, revealing that he had found it at the site. This causes the trio to fight playfully about who should get to raise and keep the [Egg]. [Brock] takes the [Egg] and runs away, promising to "take good care of it", with [Ash] and [Misty] in tow. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] and their [Pokémon] are still trapped in the cave, with the sleeping [Fossil] [Pokémon] only feet away.


The scene opens on [Pikachu] climbing in a tree. All of a sudden, something gets stuck in [Pikachu]'s throat after he has been looking through the tree, evident by [Pikachu]'s voice sounding weird. [Brock] quickly suggests that they take [Pikachu] to see a doctor. They run down the path to look for a [[Pokémon] Center], but there isn't one for miles. They eventually reach a hospital for humans and ask for help from a doctor. The doctor ([Dr. Proctor]) doesn't pay much attention to [Ash]'s pleas, but when [Misty] starts pleading the doctor gives in, saying that he can't resist a pretty face. Thinking [Misty] is the one in need of help, the doctor asks her what the problem was. After explaining that [Pikachu] was the sick one, [Ash] once again asks for help. Although a hospital for humans, the doctor agrees to help; however, the doctor refuses at first. After checking on [Pikachu], the doctor states that there is something stuck in [Pikachu]'s throat. The doctor manages to remove the thing in his throat, which happens to be an apple; [Pikachu] is now okay.
The phone then starts ringing; the doctor refuses to answer, saying he's "off duty". [Brock] answers the call and he learns that it's [Nurse Joy]. She informs the group that there has been a violent accident involving a truck of [Pokémon] stolen by [Team Rocket], and the [Pokémon] are in dire need of medical attention. With the [[Pokémon] Center] at full capacity, the extra room of the hospital is needed. Instead of giving [Nurse Joy] a serious answer, he asks her out, making her angry. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] are at the scene of the accident, with [Jessie] blaming [James] for the accident. [Meowth] is feeling down because the charm on his head is missing. Back at the hospital, the doctor gives everyone their uniforms and equipment, saying that he needs their help because he is short on staff. When the injured [Pokémon] arrive on stretchers pushed by [Chansey], everyone starts working. [Ash] calls out his [Bulbasaur] to hold down [Cubone] who keeps on struggling in pain. [Misty] comforts it and successfully calms it down. [Dr. Proctor] says that [Misty] is a natural.
[Team Rocket] comes in, bringing more patients, namely [[Jessie]'s [Arbok]] and a [Raticate]. The doctor proceeds by asking [Jessie] out for some pizza. [Jessie] is impressed with the doctor. [Ash] tells the doctor not to help [Team Rocket], but [Dr. Proctor] explains that it was his job to heal, not to judge. [Meowth] is still stressing over the loss of his charm; [Chansey] tries to cheer him up, but does not succeed.
Everyone is busy helping all the injured [Pokémon]; even [Jessie] and [James] pitch in. They are all working together diligently. They help [Pokémon] such as a [Pinsir], a [Weepinbell], a [Voltorb], a [Hitmonlee], a [Nidoking], a [Sandslash], a [Parasect], and [[James]'s [Weezing]]. There is a hyper [Dodrio] in need of untangling, so the doctor prepares an anesthetic injection, so as to calm it down. The [Dodrio] lunges at [Dr. Proctor], causing the doctor to inadvertently stab himself with the injection. The doctor then falls asleep. With no doctor on hand, [Ash] decides to weaken [Dodrio] with his own [Pokémon]. He has [Squirtle] use [[Water] Gun] followed by [Pikachu]'s [Thunderbolt]. Caught up in the moment, [Ash] pulls out a [[Poké] Ball] to catch the [Pokémon]. [Ash] is stopped by [Brock], who reminds him that they want to help [Dodrio], not catch it.
Later, while treatment is still going on, [Jessie] and [James] decide that they are going to steal all of the injured [Pokémon]. They take off the uniforms and start reciting their motto. They didn't manage to finish it because [Meowth] unexpectedly interrupts them, still wanting his charm. [Jessie] and [James] try to hold back [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] with a "stretcher catcher" contraption. [Chansey] faces [James], who threatens [Ash] with a big needle. [Jessie] commands [Arbok] and [James] commands [Weezing] to attack [Chansey], but they didn't budge one bit. [Dr. Proctor], who has just awoken, states that [Arbok] and [Weezing] will not attack [Chansey] because they were cared for by it when they were injured. Getting angry, [Jessie] throws a beaker at him, but [Dr. Proctor] simply cuts it in half using a scalpel. [Dr. Proctor] then shows them his "arsenal" that's in his doctor's coat. His "arsenal" consists of sharp tools, such as shots, scissors, and scalpels. [Ash] and his friends are freed by the [Chansey]. [Team Rocket] runs out of the building being chased by the "stretcher catchers" [Ash] and his friends had pushed their way. [Team Rocket] ends up "blasting off again" when the [Voltorb] that [James] snuck away with self-destructs. Upon landing, the charm on [Meowth]'s head pops out of its head (where it had been all along), making him very happy.
With the [Pokémon] all treated, [Dr. Proctor] tell [Ash] and his friends that they should be doctors and asks them if they want to stay and train. [Misty] states her interest in becoming a doctor but she still has a lot to learn about water [Pokémon]. [Ash] and friends then bid farewell to the good doctor and continue on their journey.


[Ash], [Pikachu], [Misty], and [Brock] are merrily walking across the countryside when they come across a poster of a young boy, with the word 'Missing' above it, who bears a great resemblance to [James] of [Team Rocket]. Just then, a limousine shows up, and an old man asks the group if they've seen the boy. [Ash] answers, "We have if he's [James] from [Team Rocket]." Excited by hearing their answer, the man takes the gang with him in the limo. [Jessie], [James], and [Meowth] show up shortly afterwards and examine the poster. [Jessie] and [Meowth] are convinced that the boy in the poster is [James], but he denies it. Reluctantly, [James] agrees to follow [Ash] and friends in the limousine.
When the limousine arrives at a sizable mansion, the old man, who is revealed to be [James]'s Butler [Hopkins], informs everyone that the mansion is merely the home of [James]'s [Growlithe], [Growlie]. The real mansion is next door, and several times larger. [Hopkins] tells [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] all about how [James]'s family is very wealthy, and that [James] ran away from his home at a young age. [Hopkins] tells our heroes that both of [James]'s parents passed away earlier that morning, and unless [James] marries his fiancée in twenty-four hours, everything his parents had left for him will go to charity. [Team Rocket] has also arrived, and is hiding out of sight on the roof. They are hearing everything [Hopkins] is saying, and [James] isn't very keen.
As the gang wonder how to find [James] to tell him the news, [Team Rocket] fall off the roof in front of them; [Jessie] and [Meowth], thinking of [James]'s inheritance, are beating on him because he refuses to get married. [Ash] tells them to stop, and [Brock] agrees that it's [James]'s decision on whether he wants to get married or not. [James], distraught, then tells everyone a story from before he dropped out of [[Pokémon] Tech] and joined a bicycle gang. He tells everyone of when he died on a cold night with [Growlie] howling sadly into the night. Everyone else is left crying, except [Misty], who loudly exclaims that the story is false, as [James] is standing right in front of them. [James], stating he is confused about the past, makes a run for it, but [Jessie] and [Meowth] lasso him back. They want him to fake the wedding, and then run off with the cash.
A few minutes later, [James] has changed into a blue suit and has his mouth covered; [Jessie] and [Meowth] are wearing "invisible costumes". They knock on the door, [Jessie] speaking for [James] behind her "invisible costume", and [Hopkins] is overjoyed to see his master home again. [Ash] and his friends are confused as to why [Hopkins] can't see [Jessie] and [Meowth]. He then takes [James] up to the room where his deceased parents rest in peace. [Jessie], still speaking for [James], begins to blurt out how she (he) wants the money. But then, laughing can be heard from inside the coffins - and out jump [James]'s parents, both alive! [James] explains to [Jessie] and [Meowth] that he knew that they would "pull a stunt like this" to try and get him to come home. Now it is revealed that [James] isn't confused about the past, and the reason for wanting to leave so badly was because he doesn't want to get married. [James] tries to escape, but is caught by [Hopkins] immediately, along with [Jessie] and [Meowth]. [Ash] and friends realize that this was all part of a big plan to get [James] to come home and get married.
Upstairs in the mansion, [James]'s parents reveal their reasoning for capturing [James]: to marry and continue the family line. [James] is very reluctant to see his future wife, [Jessebelle], who seems to be a dead ringer for [Jessie]; everyone is surprised by the resemblance. [James] wants to leave, but [Jessie] and [Meowth], still wearing their "invisible costumes", tell him that they want him to marry [Jessebelle] so that he can get his parents' inheritance; no one, except for [Ash], [Brock], and [Misty], seem to notice [Jessie] and [Meowth].
[Jessebelle] lures [Team Rocket] down into the 'vault' by saying they'll count all of the money that [James] will inherit, followed closely behind by [Ash] and his friends. This entire time, [Jessie] is covering [James]'s mouth, restraining him, and speaking for him, while [Meowth] moves his feet to walk. Down in the basement, [James]'s parents appear and tell him that he needs to be taught a lesson for running away from home, as well as tell [Jessie] and [Meowth] that they have been aware of them the entire time and only pretended to not notice. [Jessebelle] begins having fun cracking her whip at her future husband, chasing him around the room. [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock], hiding in the background, decide not to get involved in the "family squabble". [Jessebelle] pits her [Pokémon], [Vileplume], against [James], knocking him out along with everyone else (except [James]'s parents), with [Stun [Spore]]. Before going down, [James] exclaims, "This is just like last time." [Jessebelle] then vows to force [James] to become a gentleman even if it destroys both of them.
[Ash]'s group, along with [Jessie] and [Meowth], are then thrown out of the mansion. Everyone hears a pounding on the doghouse door, which bursts open to reveal [Growlie]. The [Growlithe] then runs into the mansion and appears in front of [James], as if to protect him. [Jessebelle] orders [Vileplume] to use [Stun [Spore]] on [Growlie], but it lifts [James] onto its back, and jumps out of the mansion window before it hits. [Jessebelle], standing on the mansion roof, then proclaims, "I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth, and the bottom of the sea, [James] dearest."
[James], [Growlie], and the others hide in the doghouse, where [James] thanks [Growlie] for saving him. [Jessie] is disgusted by [Jessebelle]'s behavior, and [James] explains that [Jessebelle] is the real reason he left home. Ever since the announcement of their engagement, [Jessebelle] kept following [James] everywhere he went. A flashback shows a young [James] running out of his house with a young [Jessebelle], carrying an [Oddish], far behind, shouting that he is "not running properly". As the flashback ends, [James] admits that if he marries [Jessebelle], it will be the worst mistake of his life, and that [Growlie] is the only real friend he has on the estate. Suddenly, [Jessebelle] and [Vileplume] burst through the wall, sending [Jessie] and [Meowth] flying, and a battle ensues. [Vileplume] tries another [Stun [Spore]], but [Growlie] and [Pikachu] shoot a combination of [Flamethrower] and [ThunderShock] right back at it, causing [Jessebelle] and [Vileplume] to run away in fear.
[Jessebelle] knocks [James]'s parents, [Hopkins], and [Vileplume] into a pond while running away, proclaiming how much she hates [Growlie], leaving them convinced that she's too good for their son. From the bushes, [James] says goodbye to [Growlie] and asks it to look after his parents, because [James] would rather live the free low-life with [Team Rocket] instead of the upper-crust lifestyle. [Growlie] howls sadly as [James] heads off.
Meanwhile, [Jessie] and [Meowth] lament the loss of [James], believing him to have left with [Jessebelle]. But then they hear a familiar voice that says "Prepare for trouble." It is [James], flying in the [Meowth] balloon; [James] pulls [Jessie] aboard, and they vow to continue their own free lifestyle. As [Jessie] and [James] look into each other's eyes, [Meowth] yells from the ground that they forgot him.
[Ash], [Misty], [Brock], and [Pikachu] end up being chased by [Jessebelle] away from the mansion, who's pleading for them to help her find her beloved [James]. [Ash] then yells back that [James] is usually the one who finds them.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] decide to take a break in a meadow, along with [Pikachu] and [Psyduck]. The group begin discussing the rumor that the rare [Farfetch'd] has been spotted in the area; [Ash] immediately decides he wants to catch it. [Brock], [Ash], and [Pikachu] then decide to get some water for the group from a nearby spring. Left alone, [Misty] begins hearing sounds, and she thinks it is [Psyduck]. All of a sudden, a [Farfetch'd] appears nearby and begins parading in front of [Misty], and then runs into the woods. [Misty], eager to catch the [Pokémon], calls [Psyduck] into its [[Poké] Ball] and runs after it. She chases after the flying [Pokémon], but then, just after turning a corner, bumps into a boy, [Keith], and falls over. The boy apologizes, hands [Misty] her bag that had fallen to the ground, and runs off in a hurry.
Sad from losing track of the [Farfetch'd], [Misty] returns to the meadow where [Ash] and [Brock] are looking for her. She reveals that she was trying to catch a [Farfetch'd], which causes [Ash] and [Brock] to become infuriated that she was sneaking around behind their backs. They soon calm down after hearing from [Misty] how much of an awesome [Pokémon] [Farfetch'd] is. [Brock] hands [Misty] the water that he had gotten for her, but when she goes to put it in her bag she realizes something shocking: the backpack is filled with rocks! She deduces that she must have picked up the wrong backpack when she bumped into the boy in the woods, and is upset because all of the [Pokémon] she had ever caught were in that backpack.
Back in the woods, [Keith] is walking down a path with the [Farfetch'd] by his side. He looks inside the newly stolen backpack to inspect what he has found, which turns out to be five [[Poké] Balls]. He returns to his tent, which is filled with other backpacks that likely were inherited by the same way [Misty]'s was: by using his [Farfetch'd] as a distraction so he could steal other [Trainers]' [Pokémon]. Just then, [Keith] and [Farfetch'd] spot [Team Rocket] walking by. As it turns out, [Team Rocket] is also looking for a [Farfetch'd]. [Keith] and his [Farfetch'd] approach [Team Rocket], who are disappointed by the fact that the [Pokémon] already has a master. The boy states that he was planning on getting rid of his [Farfetch'd], along with a [Staryu] ([Misty]'s) and [Starmie] (also [Misty]'s), and proposes that they could work out some sort of deal.
[Keith] and [Team Rocket] stop at a dock to take a small boat across a river, when the boy "remembers" something he forgot. He runs off, saying he'll be right back, leaving [Team Rocket] with [Farfetch'd] and all of [Keith]'s [Pokémon] in a backpack. Naturally, they try to steal them, and take the small boat themselves, but this is exactly what the boy wanted them to do; a cork comes loose in the bottom of the boat, causing it to sink. [Jessie] and [James] lose [Arbok] and [Weezing] (and [Lickitung]), whose [[Poké] Balls] are floating down stream. When [Team Rocket] goes into [Keith]'s bag to get [Staryu] and [Starmie] to help themselves out of the water, they discover the bag is full of rocks, just as [Misty]'s was earlier. [Farfetch'd] gathers the [[Poké] Balls], and sends [Team Rocket] over a waterfall. The [Pokémon] swims to shore to find [Keith] waiting for him; the duo has succeeded at yet another plot of thievery.
[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] run to the nearest police station, and tell [Officer Jenny] what had happened to [Misty]'s [Pokémon], still believing the whole thing was an accident. Jenny tells them that [Misty] is the fifth victim of the backpack-switching thief just that week; she informs everyone of how she has been trying to catch the perpetrator, to no avail.
Back at [Keith]'s tent, he begins talking to himself about his situation. He states that he and his [Farfetch'd] had been together for a long time; they had been together ever since he found it injured and nursed it back to health. He reveals that just after his [Farfetch'd] was healed, they started stealing other [Trainers]' [Pokémon]. He believes the only way to survive is to steal because they are too weak to battle; he genuinely wishes there was another way to get by. Inside the tent, [[Misty]'s [Psyduck]] releases itself from its [[Poké] Ball] and walks off without [Keith], or [Farfetch'd], noticing.
[Misty] and the group take [Officer Jenny] to the place in the woods where she bumped into [Keith]. Just then, [Psyduck] appears from behind a bush. [Misty] asks her [Pokémon] some questions about where it was and where her bag is, but the [Psyduck] seems unable to provide any useful information. Desperate to find her bag, [Misty] has [Psyduck] try to lead the group to where it came from.
[Team Rocket], in the [[Meowth] Balloon], are extremely angry, and out to find [Keith] and their [Pokémon]. They run into him just as he's packing up his tent, and all of the [Pokémon] he stole, and ready to get on the road. The boy tries to return their [Pokémon] by saying the whole thing was just a joke, and in return he can just leave, but [Team Rocket] wants more. So [Keith] gives them a whole bag full of [[Poké] Balls], along with his "apologies"; [Team Rocket] decides to forgive him, and they take off in their balloon with all of the [[Poké] Balls].
Shortly after [Team Rocket] leaves, [Ash], [Misty], [Brock], and [Officer Jenny] arrive, [Psyduck] having led them correctly. Everyone surrounds [Keith], confronting him about his stealing. [Ash] expresses how much time and care [Trainers] put into raising their [Pokémon]. The group decides that they would have a [Pokémon] battle to teach him a lesson, so [Keith] could see how difficult a match is really. He then explains that his [Farfetch'd] is too weak to battle, and he has no choice but to steal [Pokémon]. [Brock] discounts this and says that [Pokémon] will become stronger with [Trainers] who work with them. Just as [Keith] begins to rebut, [Farfetch'd] expresses an interest in battling. [Ash] jumps in and sends out [Bulbasaur] to battle, and orders a [Tackle] attack from the [Pokémon]. With every strike of [Bulbasaur]'s [Vine Whip], [Farfetch'd] seems to becomes more and more energized to win. [Keith], completely unaware of his [Farfetch'd]'s techniques, witnesses an [Agility] attack, followed by multiple strikes of the [Pokémon]'s leek; [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]] is defeated. The boy says that he wouldn't have used [Farfetch'd] to steal if he had known it had such power. [Ash], ready to send out [Pikachu] to battle [Farfetch'd], is stopped by [Misty], who wants to battle. To her dismay, she soon realizes that her only [Pokémon] is [Psyduck]. However, [Farfetch'd] begins to hit it on the head, enough so as to give it a headache. [Psyduck] unleashes a powerful [Disable] attack, sending the [Pokémon] flying into its owner. [Misty] and [Psyduck], celebrate their victory over the [Trainer] that stole her [Pokémon].
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is opening all of the [[Poké] Balls] that [Keith] gave them, only to discover that they all contain [Voltorb]. Angry that they have been tricked again, they throw the [Voltorb] over the edge of their balloon. All of the [Pokémon], unfortunately, land directly where [Keith] and his [Farfetch'd] are, and they all self-destruct near him, [Ash], [Misty], [Brock], and Jenny. Feeling defeated, the boy promises to stop his wrongdoing.
Back at the police station, [Keith] tells [Officer Jenny] that he'll give back all of the [Pokémon] he stole. Jenny informs him that he is lucky that none of the [Trainers] are going to press charges because they all got their [Pokémon] back; [Misty] expresses her joy to have her [Pokémon] back. [Keith] now says that he knows that it was wrong to steal, and that it was wrong not to believe in [Farfetch'd]. He decides to train his [Farfetch'd] to become even stronger, and the two head off.
[Jessie] and [James], up in their balloon, consider telling their boss what happened, but [Meowth] convinces them not to; [Team Rocket] expresses embarrassment over being outsmarted by a kid. All of a sudden, they realize one [Voltorb] is left in their balloon, and it self-destructs, sending them "blasting off again".


The episode begins with [Ash] and his friends sitting in the [[Pokémon] Center]. While there, [Ash] gets a phone call from [Professor [Oak]] on the PC phone. He informs [Ash] that his [Pokédex] is now upgradeable. [Ash] uses a device within the PC to receive the upgrade. [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] sit at a nearby table and begin to discuss the [Pokémon] that they wish would hatch out of the mysterious [Egg] that [Ash] found back at the [Pokémon] [Fossil] Canyon. Naturally, they all say their favorite [Pokémon]; [Misty] wants a [[Water]-type] and [Brock], a [[Rock]-type].
The discussion concludes and they leave the [[Pokémon] Center]. Just outside, they find the [Team Rocket] posing as [Egg] sellers. The three have a whole basketful of [Eggs] that look just like [Ash]'s mysterious [Egg]. [Team Rocket] tries to talk them into trading or buying one of their [Eggs] and when the group politely refuses, [Jessie] and [James] resort to throwing all of their fake [Eggs] in the air. The real [Egg], that [Brock] was holding, gets stolen in the confusion caused by the multitude of lookalikes.
[Team Rocket] runs out of sight, escaping with the real [Egg]! [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] are stuck with a fake. Meanwhile, in [Team Rocket]'s small hiding shack, [Meowth] takes care of the [Egg]. While it is in [Meowth]'s possession, the [Egg] is lavished with attention and care. [Meowth] sleeps with it, sings to it and even eats with it, guarding it from anything he feels might damage or harm his new charge.
The three young adventurers follow a trail of broken red blue and green eggshells until they reach the shack in which [Team Rocket] is hiding. They decide to burst in, even though it may be dangerous to do so, and get the [Egg] back.
[Ash] sends out [Pidgeotto], [Misty] sends out [Staryu] and [Brock] sends out [Geodude]. They all quickly explode into the shack, surprising [Team Rocket]. [James] sends out [Weezing], who gives a [Poison Gas] attack, making [Ash] and others cough and gasp for breath. The person in possession of the [Egg] at this point is obscured by the gas. The characters all lunge for the little white [Egg]. The [Egg] is tossed up and down frantically, much like in a game of football! Through much controversy among the shack's occupants, [Pikachu] ends up with the [Egg] and gives it back to [Ash]. At that moment the [Egg] begins to glow and break open, beginning to hatch.
[Misty], enthralled with this new event, jumps in, pushing everyone else out of the way to get a closer look at the hatching [Pokémon]. When she does get a hold of it, the [Egg] hatches, revealing a new, unidentified [Pokémon]. [Ash] and others are all surprised, especially [Team Rocket], who instantly want to steal it. [Ash] points his newly updated [Pokédex] at the [Pokémon], identifying it as a [Togepi].
[Togepi], unlike other [Pokémon], will not bond with just anybody, to [Ash]'s and [Brock]'s disappointment. To everyone's surprise, the baby [Togepi] chooses [Misty]! Because [Misty] is the first thing that the [Pokémon] saw after hatching, it thinks that [Misty] is its mother.
This newly hatched [Pokémon] causes quite a fuss among the group. [Ash] feels that he should have it because he found it; [Brock] feels it should be his because he cared for it before [Meowth]; [Meowth] wants it because he looked after it just before it hatched; [Jessie] and [James] both just want it! [Meowth] points out to them that his partners didn't do anything to help in [Togepi]'s growth. [Misty] feels she should have it, as [Togepi] likes her best. They all decide to have a [Pokémon] tournament to determine who should have [Togepi].
[Meowth] panics because he has no [Pokémon], and goes and asks [Jessie] and [James] for theirs. They refuse, as he didn't let them participate in the tournament; [Meowth] then remembers that he is a [Pokémon] and decides to battle for himself. After the draw, the final match ends up being between [Misty] and [Ash], in their first battle since [Cerulean City]. [Ash] sends out [Bulbasaur] and [Misty] attempted to send out [Staryu], but instead [Psyduck] popped out. [Misty] instructs [Bulbasaur] to attack [Psyduck] on the head to worsen its chronic headache, but [Ash] decides to use [Bulbasaur] for a different manner, and commands it to lick [Psyduck] on the head and tickle it until [Psyduck] went back in its [[Poké] Ball]. [Ash] and [Meowth] battle, but it is cut short after one [Thunderbolt] by [Pikachu]. Thus, [Ash] is the winner of the tournament. [Jessie] and [James] drag a crisp, sobbing [Meowth] away. After the tournament, [Togepi] still doesn't want to go with [Ash], or [Brock], instead still choosing [Misty]. [Ash]'s [Pokédex] explains that, when [Togepi] hatched, it imprinted on her as its parent.


This story begins with [Ash] and his friends heading for the [Cinnabar [Gym]]. [Ash]'s path is not easy as he has to battle other [Trainers] along the way. When walking along, he comes across a [Hiker] that challenges him to a battle. The [Trainer] sends out a [Rhyhorn] while [Ash] counters with [Bulbasaur]. [Rhyhorn] executes a [Take Down] attack. The ground shakes as it charges right at [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]]. [Pikachu] does not like this and puts on a look of desperation on his face. [Ash] commands his [Bulbasaur] to use [Leech Seed], but [Rhyhorn] closes in and sends [Bulbasaur] flying before the attack is launched. [Ash] tries to recall [Bulbasaur], but [Bulbasaur] refuses. [Brock] states that it will not back down until it wins and it seems that [Bulbasaur] really wants to battle it. The [Hiker] says [Ash] must be a bad [Trainer] if his own [Pokémon] does not listen to him and cannot even return it to its [[Poké] Ball] when told. [Rhyhorn] charges again, but [Bulbasaur] uses [Razor Leaf], stopping it dead in its tracks before following up with a [Vine Whip]. [Rhyhorn] collapses and [Ash] wins. The [Hiker] commends [Ash] for training [Bulbasaur] well. [Ash] then notices that his [Bulbasaur] cannot get up, its bulb pulsating a blue glow.
They rush [Bulbasaur] to the nearest [[Pokémon] Center]. [Ash] tells [Nurse Joy] about what happened and asks her to save it. [Nurse Joy] hooks up [Bulbasaur] to a machine and runs some tests. Afterward, she returns to [Ash] and informs him that [Bulbasaur] is not sick at all. It is almost ready to evolve! [Ash] is purely excited, but [Bulbasaur] overhears [Ash], not appearing to be as happy. [Nurse Joy] tells [Ash] that it will evolve at a special festival for [Bulbasaur].
Everyone is asleep at the [[Pokémon] Center] and a long line of [Bulbasaur] goes past. [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]] gets up and watches the view from above, with [Pikachu] accompanying him. Suddenly, a group of [Bulbasaur] use their Vines to grab [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]] and take it to their garden. [Pikachu] then heads back to the [[Pokémon] Center] to wake up [Ash] and the others, and they decide to follow him to find [Bulbasaur].
[Jessie] and [James] show up and [Jessie] sees all the beautiful flowers, enjoying them. [James] disagrees as he has allergies. Suddenly, they walk right past the big group of [Bulbasaur] holding [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]]. [Jessie] says they should capture them, but the [Bulbasaur] all hit them with their vines, and they blast off again.
They are all following [Pikachu]. [Brock] says if they follow the trail of pollen, they might find [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]]. Suddenly, the roots of a bunch of tree start thrashing around. A bunch of vines starts blocking their path to try to stop them from getting through. [Ash] says they will not stop, and they dive through them just in time. They were inside the Great Mysterious Garden, the legend was true, Inside are thousands of [Bulbasaur].
Suddenly a tree starts to open and a [Venusaur] appears. It climbs on a big tree stump. [Ash] then scans it on his [Pokédex]. [Brock] comments on the description, saying that it makes it sound like a plant.
The gang searches for [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]]; when they realize it has a bandage on its head, they manage to spot it. [Team Rocket] cannot get through the wall of vines. [James] asks [Meowth] to scratch his way through, and [Meowth] says he just had his claws filed. [Jessie] and [James] get out an axe and a saw. However, the vines attack them, and chase them away. [Ash] tries to yell out to his [Bulbasaur]; [Brock] stops him and reminds him that humans have never been in this garden before. All of the [Bulbasaur] are happy except for [Ash]'s. All of the bulbs on the [Bulbasaur]'s backs begin to glow.
The [Bulbasaur] start to evolve into [Ivysaur] one by one. [Brock] says that people have always disagreed whether [Bulbasaur] is a plant or animal. He says that maybe [Bulbasaur] are a symbol that all life on Earth is connected. [Ash] points out that his [Bulbasaur] is struggling to not evolve. The [Venusaur] yells at it, and all the [Ivysaur] start getting mad. The [Venusaur] is about to hit [Bulbasaur] with its [Vine Whip], but [Ash] blocks it just in time.
[Ash] apologizes for coming to their festival, but states [Bulbasaur] is his friend. He asks if they are mad that [Bulbasaur] will not evolve, and they all nod. [Ash] says that if [Bulbasaur] does not want to evolve, they cannot force it to. A bunch of pollen comes from the flower on [Venusaur]'s back and goes on the tree, causing it to grow more. [Misty] says that it's manipulating nature. [Venusaur] says to [Bulbasaur] that if it evolves, it could do that too. It still refuses to evolve.
[Team Rocket] arrives in their balloon. All of a sudden, they start sucking up the [Ivysaur] into a bag. [Pikachu] flies up and [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]] catches him with its vine. [Ash] tells [Bulbasaur] to knock [Team Rocket] out of the sky. [Bulbasaur] tries using [Razor Leaf], but it fails. [James] asks if they should get [Bulbasaur], and [Jessie] and [Meowth] just laugh, saying [Bulbasaur] is a wimp. [Bulbasaur] shouts and the sun suddenly rises over the horizon. The sun's rays enters through the opening into the top of the bulb in [Bulbasaur]'s back. The [Pokédex] says it's getting ready to use [Solar Beam]. [Ash] tells it to ready its [Solar Beam]. The bulb glows, and a huge, blue beam of energy shoots out, hitting the balloon. The balloon explodes, and [Bulbasaur] frees all the [Ivysaur] with [Razor Leaf].
[Team Rocket] falls to the ground in the basket. All the [Pokémon] are mad. They hit [Team Rocket] at once with all their vines, and they go flying for the second time in one episode. [Ash] says [Bulbasaur] did great. [Venusaur] agrees, extending a vine. [Bulbasaur] extends its vine and connects with [Venusaur] as a sign of respect.
[Ash] and the others leave. They notice that the garden has disappeared. They wave goodbye to [Venusaur] and [Ivysaur].


The episode begins with [Misty] and [Jessie] getting excited about The [Princess Festival], a holiday with events, shopping sales and discounts, festivals, and games that are exclusively for women. The narrator explains this over [Misty] going on a shopping spree, making [Ash], [Brock], and even [Pikachu] carry her purchases. After the title screen, [Misty] and [Jessie] are shown enjoying the perks of the [Princess Festival] in [[O-Hina] Town], which leads to [Jessie] catching a [Lickitung]. [Jessie] then drags [James] and [Meowth] with her to do more shopping, where she encounters [Misty]. The two fight over a dress, only to have another shopper grab it while they aren't looking. They quickly forget about it when an announcement is made over the store's intercom about the Queen of the [Princess Festival] contest. [Jessie] and [Misty] decide to enter, fueled by their desire for the prize; [Pokémon] Princess Dolls. The other prize is a picture with a movie star named [[Fiorella] Cappuccino], but they don't show interest in that.
The next scene is the competition, where we see Fiorello, an announcer, and a line of pretty girls dressed in kimonos on a stage, including [Jessie] and [Misty]! The announcer then brings everyone's attention to the prize, a one of a kind set of [Pokémon] Princess Dolls. Fiorello, who is also an announcer for the competition, adds that he is part of the prize, too, causing an uproar in the crowd. Then, a startling announcement is made; the contest isn't just a beauty pageant... it's also a [Pokémon] battle competition! The contestants are split into divisions, and they must use four [Pokémon] to battle.
[Misty] then begs [Ash] and [Brock] to let her use their [Pokémon] for the contest. They reluctantly agree. [Misty]'s team of four consists of [Pikachu], [Bulbasaur], [Vulpix], and her [Starmie]. Then, [Ash] gets confused to why [Misty] wants to meet Fiorello, thinking [Misty] wants to win the contest to meet him. [Misty] explains that she just wants the dolls, because her sisters all had their own dolls sets, but she only got their hand-me-down dolls, which were broken by the time she got them. So she has always wanted a [Pokémon] doll set of her own.
The next scene is a montage of [Misty] and [Jessie] winning several matches. During this scene, [Jessie]'s team consists of [Arbok], [Weezing], and [Meowth]. [Misty] and [Jessie] then face off in the finals, but not until after [Jessie] has a sad flashback. She talks about being a little girl, she used to hate the [Princess Festivals] because, like [Misty], of how she never had a [Pokémon] Princess Doll of her own, while all the other little girls did. The story brings the emotional trio to tears, and [James] and [Meowth] give her support. When they're done with this, [Misty] and [Jessie] proceed with the match. [Pikachu] makes quick work of [Arbok], [Weezing], and [Meowth]. At first, [Jessie] and [James] lose hope that she will win the contest, but then [Meowth] reminds her that she caught a [Lickitung] earlier, and the battle continues! [Lickitung] easily defeats [Pikachu], [Bulbasaur], and [Vulpix] with its tongue movements! Then, when [Misty] tries to send out [Staryu] (because earlier, she said she planned on using her [Starmie]), but her [Psyduck] pops out instead! At first, [Misty] is in despair, thinking that she can never win now! But in an unexpected turn of events, [Lickitung]'s attacks give [Psyduck] a headache, triggering its potent psychic powers! [Misty] then wins the match with [Psyduck]'s [Confusion], while blasting off [Team Rocket] in the process!
In the end, [Misty] sends the dolls to the [Cerulean [Gym]] to make her sisters jealous. As for [Team Rocket], [James], [Meowth], [Arbok], [Weezing], and [Lickitung] dressed up as [Pokémon] dolls to make her feel better. [Jessie] was moved to tears, and pretended to be a [Pokémon] doll along with them.


The episode begins with [Ash] and his friends walking along a dirt path. They come across a few [Pokémon] banners and immediately recognize that it's [Kids Day]. Suddenly, someone mistakes the trio for the [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] they've been looking for. Once she receives a phone call, she realizes that [Ash] and company are not the [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] she was searching for. However, after hearing how she wanted to do something special for the children she teaches at the pre-school, the trio decides to let the children play with their [Pokémon].
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] reminisces about [Kids Day]. [James] always had a great [Kids Day], whereas [Jessie] did not.
The episode goes back to [Ash] and his friends inside the school. The children rush over to play with [Pikachu], who has to be taken away by [Ash] before he electrocutes the children. [Misty] and [Brock] also let out their [Pokémon], who all begin playing with the kids. However, there is one child who is off on his own. This child, [Timmy] has no interest in playing with any [Pokémon] besides [Meowth]. He further explains that this is due to a wild [Meowth] saving him from a [Beedrill]. However, the children are in total disbelief and mock him.
Suddenly, a bright van pulls up to the school where [Jessie], disguised a magician, convinces the teacher to let her, [James], and [Meowth] do a magic show for the children. She agrees and [Team Rocket] sets up. They show the children, the gang, and the teacher an empty box, and claim that they need a volunteer. [Pikachu] is swept up by [James] who places him into the box. Both [Jessie] and [James] chant before tapping the box with a wand. [Meowth] flies from the box and completes the trick, much to the kids' enjoyment.
The trio try to make their getaway, but are stopped by [Ash] who demands his [Pikachu] back. [Team Rocket] reveals themselves, but are attacked by the overly excited children. They begin to bounce around [Weezing] before the teacher yells at them to quiet down and leave [Team Rocket] alone. Getting back down to business, [James] tells [Weezing] to use [SmokeScreen] which is able to blind the gang.
[Timmy], upon seeing [Meowth]'s distress, rushes over to help, but knocks down the box [Meowth] was standing on. This also knocks [Pikachu] out of the box, unbeknownst to everyone else. [Team Rocket] picks up the box and rushes off to escape. [Ash] worriedly calls out to [Pikachu], but [Pikachu] is safe and sound inside the school. However, the teacher says that [Timmy] has gone missing. Then [Misty] does a [Meowth] impression.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] rejoices over their capture and opens the box, hoping to pull out [Pikachu]. Instead, they pull [Timmy] from the box, who proceeds to cry. The tears stop when he sees [Meowth]. He runs over to [Meowth], thanking him for saving his life from the wild [Beedrill]. [Meowth] is about to tell him he has the wrong [Pokémon], but [Jessie] and [James] convince [Meowth] to go along with the kid to avoid crushing his feelings.
Putting on an act, [Jessie] and [James] behave like they want to do harm to [Timmy]. [Meowth] jumps in front of him and uses [Fury Swipes] to knock [Jessie] and [James] down. [Meowth] grabs [Timmy]'s hand and makes a run for it. They come running back to the school, surprising everyone. The children see [Meowth] and apologize for not believing [Timmy]'s story in the first place and [Timmy] accepts their apologies and allows them to play with [Meowth], who relishes in the attention.
[Meowth] accidentally lets some human speech slip from his mouth, getting [Misty] to call him out. In desperation, he makes a run for it, much to the dismay of [Timmy] and his classmates. [Timmy] chases after [Meowth], followed by everyone else. [Meowth] is able to make it back to [Team Rocket], but he is followed by everyone. [Team Rocket] recites their motto once more and challenges [Ash] to a battle. [Jessie] sends out [Arbok] while [James] sends out his [Weezing]. [Ash] calls his [Pidgeotto] out and [Brock] helps by using [Onix].
[Weezing] uses [Smog], which is easily blown away by [Pidgeotto]'s [Gust], along with [Weezing] itself. [Arbok], however, escapes by using [Dig]. [Arbok] pops up in front of the gang, but was tackled by [Onix]. This tackle causes part of the rock on the cliff [Arbok] slammed into to crumble and roll. Everyone is able to escape with the exception of [Ash] and [Timmy]. However, a wild [Meowth] comes out of nowhere, kicking the boulder in two and saving their lives. [Timmy] immediately recognizes this [Meowth] as the one that had saved him before.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is running atop a second boulder, disappearing from sight while chasing their [Meowth], unable to stop rolling.
Once back at the school, the teacher thanks [Ash] and his friends for all their help. [Timmy] proclaims he's going to become a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] as well, hinting that the wild [Meowth] is now his. Finally, our heroes say goodbye to their new friends.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are traveling through the forest heading to [Cinnabar Island] when they hear [Officer Jenny]'s voice calling after a thief. Looking round they see a man with a sack over his shoulder and a gun in hand. [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to attack the thief but seeing the gun in the man's hand [Pikachu] hides and refuses to attack. Once again the trio hears [Officer Jenny]'s voice, this time ordering a [Growlithe] to attack the thief which it does knocking him down and sending the gun flying from his grasp. The thief now safely disarmed, [Pikachu] has no cause to fear, and [Ash] quickly orders [Pikachu] to attack, shocking the thief with a [ThunderShock].
However the [Growlithe] then turn on [Ash] and his friends, surrounding them in a circle as [Officer Jenny] and two other policemen rush to the thief's side. Confronting the trio [Officer Jenny] reveals that the "thief" was in fact a police officer helping to train the canine police unit. Realizing their honest mistake, [Officer Jenny] calls off the [Growlithe] squad lining them up and introducing the trio to them as "new friends".
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is watching from a nearby tree, commenting that the boss would love it if they captured police trained [Pokémon], and [James] announces he has come up with the perfect plan to steal the [Growlithe].
Later that evening, [Ash], [Misty] and [Brock] are sitting down to a hearty meal at the training facility. As the conversation turns to discussing the day's events, [Ash] remarks that the [Growlithe] tasked with bringing down the thief-impersonator was braver than [Pikachu], however [Brock] and [Misty] quickly point out that [Pikachu] could have been very badly hurt by a gun-wielding opponent. [Officer Jenny] backs them saying that to attack an armed opponent is very dangerous unless the [Pokémon] has special training. [Ash] expresses interest in training [Pikachu] along with the police [Growlithe] in order to improve his battling abilities. [Officer Jenny] agrees to let [Pikachu] participate in the training class they will be running tomorrow. During this conversation [Togepi] wandered off after a piece of food that rolled to the edge of the table. Seeing it about to fall off, [Pikachu] rushed to save it, but instead it was [Pikachu] that overbalanced and fell off the edge of the table.
The morning is heralded by a crowing [Dodrio] as [Ash] and his friends sleep in their bunks; however, their sleep is cut short by [Officer Jenny]'s sudden whistle as she wakes [Ash] up for their training. [Ash] tiredly looks at a clock and finds out that it's four o'clock in the morning. [Ash] goes back to sleep, and [Officer Jenny] blows her whistle again, this time waking up [Misty] and [Togepi] as well. Later that morning, the training begins with an obstacle course that, as [Ash] is surprised to learn, is to be completed by both the [Trainer] and their [Pokémon]. The first obstacle is a wire net under which the runners must crawl, leading to problems as, despite his small size, [Pikachu]'s tail gets caught in the wire, shocking [Ash] as he attempts to use his electricity to free himself. Next is a high wall which [Officer Jenny] and [Growlithe] scale easily, but which [Ash] fails to get over, falling backward on top of [Pikachu], resulting in another shock for [Ash].
After the test, [Brock] questions the wisdom of the training program, believing that [Pikachu] is already very powerful. When [Ash] asks if [Pikachu] wants to be as tough as [Growlithe] he bows his head, exhausted from their training. This discussion is interrupted as a van painted to resemble a [Growlithe] breaks through the wall of the compound.
[Team Rocket] emerges from the van and, as the dust from their entry clears, says their motto. Naturally the van is quickly surrounded by [Growlithe] as [Team Rocket] reveals their plan to use the [Growlithe] to commit crimes. [Brock] questions why they would even attempt breaking into a police facility, as doing so is like asking to be arrested. Quickly [Team Rocket] dons gas masks and begins to spray gas from a bottle marked with a picture of [Gloom] causing the [Growlithe]'s sense of smell to be disabled. Selecting a second canister, this time marked with [Psyduck], they once again spray the gas around the compound. Everyone who inhaled the gas finds that their voice has become high and squeaky. As [Officer Jenny] tries to order the [Growlithe] to arrest [Team Rocket], she finds that they won't respond to her voice, no longer recognizing it in its altered state.
Quickly changing costumes, [Team Rocket] puts on police uniforms and uses megaphone voice changers in order to impersonate [Officer Jenny]'s voice. The [Growlithe], unable to smell, immediately trust [Team Rocket] and follow their orders to arrest [Officer Jenny], tying her up with rope. With [Officer Jenny] subdued, the team begins ordering the [Growlithe] into the van, as the trio attempts to stop them. [Jessie], still using [Officer Jenny]'s voice, orders the [Growlithe] to surround [Ash] and his friends. Their attempts to fight back are foiled by the fact that they left their [[Poké] Balls] back in their room. However, [Pikachu] scares the [Growlithe] back with an electric attack.
[Jessie] quickly changes her costume to resemble [Ash], switches her megaphone to mimic [Ash]'s voice and orders [Pikachu] into the van with the [Growlithe]. [Pikachu]'s ears prick up at the sound of [Ash]'s voice, but after a moment of confusion, he returns to [Ash]'s side, recognizing what is in each other's hearts. Realizing that they can't capture [Pikachu] using fake voices, [Team Rocket], using [Officer Jenny]'s voice once more, orders the [Growlithe] to attack, but [Pikachu] leaps into the air and uses [ThunderShock] to defeat the [Growlithe] sent to attack. However, the effort of the attack leaves [Pikachu] dizzy and unable to defeat the remaining [Growlithe].
At this point, [Jigglypuff] enters, abruptly leaving after only singing a few notes, insufficient to put anyone to sleep. During this distraction [Officer Jenny] was able to work herself free from the ropes, and attempts to regain control of the canine squad. [Jessie] orders them to attack [Officer Jenny], and a [Growlithe] bites her hand but then remembers [Officer Jenny] and the memories it had with her- Jenny holding it as a puppy, training and playing with it, taking care of it when it was sick. Recognizing at last the deception, the [Growlithe] turn on [Team Rocket], who in desperation begin changing their voices. However they only get each other's voices and [Meowth]'s. [Meowth], seeing that their plan is foiled, drives the van out of the yard, with [Jessie] and [James] following behind.
As they say farewell to [Officer Jenny], [Ash] realizes that [Pikachu] doesn't have to train with the canine squad to be the perfect [Pokémon]. [Brock] uses [Team Rocket]'s abandoned megaphone to impersonate [Officer Jenny]'s voice saying she loves him, to the embarrassment of [Ash] and [Misty] and the amusement of Jenny herself.
As they leave, [Brock], feeling [Team Rocket]'s megaphone is useless, abandons it only for [Jigglypuff] to find it.


As [Ash] and his friends travel, they decide to stop to eat, with [Brock] making his famous rice balls. However, [Ash] notices what he thinks is a gun pointing at [Pikachu], and knocks his friends out of the way. The rice balls are knocked into the river, angering [Brock], [Pikachu], and [Misty], and making [Togepi] cry.
[Ash] sends out [Squirtle] and commands it to use [[Water] Gun] at the bushes where he saw the "gun." [Todd] stands up and tells him to stop, afraid that his camera, what was really pointed at them, will be ruined. [Ash], mad at [Todd], asks why he was spying on them. [Todd] explains that he is a [Pokémon] photographer and didn't want his picture of [Pikachu] to look posed.
The group goes in a house to talk to [Todd]. He shows them a magazine with his picture of an [Aerodactyl] in it. The [Aerodactyl] seemed to be carrying [Ash] in its claws! [Todd] zooms in on the picture and it is revealed that it really was [Ash]. To make up for not believing him, [Todd] makes pancakes for the group.
As the group is eating their pancakes, [Todd] tries to get a picture of [Pikachu]. However, as he is taking the picture, [Pikachu] accidentally zaps [Todd]. He tries again, but gives up because "[Pokémon] should be photographed naturally, not posing." He shows them pictures he took of various [Pokémon] to prove his point.
[Pikachu] doesn't like to be photographed, so [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] send out their [Pokémon] for [Todd] to photograph. However, [Todd] says that he only wants to take pictures of [Pikachu]. They ask him why, but he says that he can't tell them.
[Ash] and his friends leave, and as they are walking down a path, [Todd] is shown hidden in the grass. A flashback is shown of [Team Rocket] dressed as seniors begging [Todd] to "capture" [Pikachu]. [Todd] agrees; however, they didn't realize that [Todd] plans to capture [Pikachu] on film.
After [Todd] leaves, [Team Rocket] is shown eating. They take off their disguises.
[Misty] and [Brock] are shown resting under a tree as [Ash] and [Pikachu] wash their faces in a pond. Twice, [Todd] tries to take [Pikachu]'s picture, but he hides behind [Ash] before he can.
[Team Rocket] is shown digging a pitfall trap. [Meowth] yells that [Todd] is coming, and [Jessie] and [James] quickly put their disguises back on. [Todd] tells them that he hasn't taken [Pikachu] yet, and [James] almost tells him about the pitfall, but [Jessie] and [Meowth] stop him. [Todd] sets up his camera and waits for [Ash] and the group to come.
[Todd] hears everyone talking about them and is dismayed to hear [Ash] say that he "doesn't even understand feelings of the [Pokémon] he takes pictures of." As they walk, however, they fall into [Team Rocket]'s pitfall trap. [Todd] walks over and looks into the hole. He sees [Pikachu] peeking out of [Ash]'s backpack and gets ready to take his picture. [Team Rocket] sees this and realizes that he is a photographer. [Todd] finally gets [Pikachu]'s picture, but then sees the ground below [Ash] start to crack. [Todd] throws a rope into the hole, but it's too late-[Ash] and [Pikachu] fall through into an underground storm drain-like place. [Todd] jumps down after them and runs along the water. He tells [Ash] to grab on to something-they will fall over the waterfall! Realizing there's nothing for them to grab, [Todd] holds out his camera on the tripod. [Ash] grabs onto the strap and realizes that [Todd] sacrificed his camera to save them.
[Team Rocket] appears and says their motto before taking off their disguises. [Meowth] uses a net to take [Pikachu] off [Ash]'s back. [Todd] asks why they tricked him, and [Jessie] answers that he tricked them first. [James] then throws some small bombs into the waterfall. [Ash] takes [Todd]'s camera off the tripod and acts like he is taking [Team Rocket]'s picture. As they wait for him to take it, however, the small bomb explodes. [Ash] pulls himself up the rest of the way with [Todd]'s tripod, then sends out [Bulbasaur] and tells it to use [Razor Leaf]. The attack tears the rubber net that [Pikachu] was in, and he escapes. [Bulbasaur] uses [Vine Whip] and chases [Team Rocket] into the water, then they fall off the waterfall. [Brock] and [Misty] run up, and everyone is reunited.
[Todd] sets up his camera to take a picture with his new friends, but he slips on a rice ball and knocks [Ash] and [Misty] down.


[Ash], [Misty], [Brock], [Todd], [Pikachu], and [Togepi] are enjoying a nice lunch until [Misty] points out that [Ash] has not won a [[Gym] [Badge]] in a while. After nearly choking on his food and washing it down with a glass of water, [Ash] claims he wins all his battles with skill, and then challenges [Misty] to a [Pokémon] battle. [Todd] steps in, takes pictures of [Pikachu], then tells [Ash] that he should take the [[Pokémon] League] Admissions Exam.
The group arrives at the [[Pokémon] League] Admissions Exam building so [Ash] signs up and gets the testing number 7. Nearby, [Jessie], disguised as a schoolgirl, complains that she didn't get number 7, causing [Ash] to briefly suspect her. Then, [Nurse Joy] enters and [Brock] follows her. [Ash] then is told by the head instructor to leave all his [[Poké] Balls] at the counter, as well as temporarily leave [Pikachu] in [Misty]'s care. Shortly, [Nurse Joy] tells [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] that she signed up for the exam to become a [[Pokémon] Master]. Soon after, [James] walks in, disguised as a schoolboy with glasses, but quickly heads for the counter once [Ash] sees him. When the head instructor reads [James]'s registration form and calls out his name, [James] tells him to keep quiet. But unfortunately, [Jessie] hears this and takes [James] outside. Once outside, [Jessie] takes off her glasses and asks [James] what he is doing there. [James] confidently says that he too wants to become a [[Pokémon] Master], as well as ask [Jessie] what she's doing here. [Jessie] explains that she wants to add another talent to her collection. Suddenly, [Meowth] shows up and scratches both their faces. [James] quickly throws [Meowth] a ball of yarn, then runs off with [Jessie] back inside for the exam.
The first exam tests a person's knowledge of [Pokémon], where they answer true or false questions. [Ash] does his best to answer each of the questions correctly. At the [Magikarp] question, [James] becomes angry because of the time he had a [Magikarp], as well as notice [Jessie] giving each question a "true" answer, hoping that she gets half of them right.
The second exam tests a person's ability to recognize [Pokémon]. The [Pokémon] to recognize on the screen looks like a ball. [Ash] thinks it's a [Voltorb], [James] thinks it's a [[Poké] Ball], and [Jessie] thinks it's an [Electrode]. The head instructor reveals the answer: a [Jigglypuff] seen from above. The next [Pokémon] to recognize looks like a swirl. [Ash] guesses it's a [Poliwhirl], [James] believes it's an [Omanyte], and [Jessie] guesses it's an [Arbok] when it's all coiled up. Unfortunately, the correct answer is a [Poliwag]. The next [Pokémon] for all the students to guess has a fiery tail, and [Ash] guesses it's a [Charmander], but the right answer was [Ponyta]. A furious [Jessie] demands that she be asked easier questions, and the head instructor expels her. Once outside, [Jessie] wakes up [Meowth] and says that they're going to get revenge.
When the scoreboard comes down, [Ash] wonders where his score is. [Misty] points out that [Ash]'s score is on the scoreboard for all the students who got the lowest scores, as [Todd] takes a picture, much to [Ash]'s chagrin. Meanwhile, [James] stands alone in a corner, vowing that he will try extra hard for [Jessie].
The third exam involves [Pokémon] battles, as [Nurse Joy] uses a [Squirtle] against a fellow instructor's [Charmander]. Next, the head instructor tells [Ash] and [James] that they each have to select a belt of three [[Poké] Balls], even though they don't know what [Pokémon] are inside them. They choose their belts, and [James] is up first against the head instructor. The first [Pokémon] [James] sends out is a [Pikachu], much to his delight. [James] believes that he can't lose with [Pikachu] and claims that he's been destroyed by [Pikachu]'s attacks so many times that he knew them all by heart. The head instructor then sends out a [Graveler]. [James] immediately commands [Pikachu] to use [Thunderbolt], but the attack doesn't work on [Graveler]. Then, [Graveler] sends [Pikachu] flying with a [Tackle]. Angry at this, [James] then sends out an [Ivysaur] and a [Charizard] at the same time. But unfortunately, the head instructor expels [James] for bringing out two [Pokémon] at once.
It is [Ash]'s turn to face the head instructor, who sends out a [Flareon]. [Ash] pulls out his first [[Poké] Ball], which reveals a [Weezing], much to [Ash]'s shock and displeasure (made only worse when [Todd] starts taking pictures of his face looking like [Weezing]'s). The instructor has [Flareon] use [Flamethrower], which [Weezing] proceeds to dodge. Coming up with an idea, [Ash] tells [Weezing] to counter with [Smog], which explodes upon being hit by the [Flamethrower], throwing [Flareon] backwards. [Flareon] then uses [Leer], but [Ash] has [Weezing] use [SmokeScreen] to hide, then follow up with a [Tackle], knocking [Flareon] out. As [Misty] comments on [Ash] being good at battling after all, [Brock] comments that even [Team Rocket] could win if they battled like that. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is taking notes of [Ash]'s fighting strategy. Next, the head instructor sends out a [Jolteon], and [Ash] sends out an [Arbok]. [Jolteon] uses [Agility], but [Arbok] stops it with [Glare]. Then, [Arbok] uses [Wrap] but gets hurt by [Jolteon]'s spikes. At this point, while [Arbok] is wincing in pain, [Jolteon] shakes off the [Glare] attack and finishes it off with [Thunder]. For the final round, [Ash] opens his last [[Poké] Ball] to reveal a [Meowth], while the head instructor sends out a [Vaporeon]. [Meowth] tries to use [Fury Swipes], but gets frozen in its tracks when [Vaporeon] uses [Ice Beam], giving the victory to the head instructor. [[Team Rocket]'s [Meowth]] scratches [Ash]'s face and frees his fellow [Meowth]. The head instructor is impressed by the talking [Meowth], so he goes to capture him. However, [Team Rocket] returns with [James]'s [Pikachu], [Ivysaur], and [Charizard]. The head instructor demands that they return those [Pokémon] immediately. [Jessie] and [James] then say their motto and remove their disguises. Then, [Team Rocket] orders [Ivysaur] to use [Vine Whip], [Charizard] to use [Flamethrower], and [Pikachu] to use [Thunder]. Before the [Pokémon] attack, the head instructor quickly orders them to about-face, causing [Pikachu], [Ivysaur], and [Charizard] to attack [Team Rocket]. [Ash] realizes that those [Pokémon] listened to the head instructor because he raised them. Then, [Ash] orders his [Meowth], [Weezing], and [Arbok] to also stop [Team Rocket]. [Weezing] uses [Explosion], sending [Team Rocket] blasting off again.
Back inside the PLAE building, the head instructor tells the whole class that due to [Team Rocket]'s interference, they have to do the entire exam all over again. The head instructor then offers [Ash] another chance to pass the test, but [Ash] refuses, saying that he's better off winning [[Gym] [Badges]] from [[Gym] Leaders]. [Misty] is now convinced that [Ash] has got skill. A short time later, as [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] say goodbye to the head instructor and [Nurse Joy] before heading off for [Cinnabar Island], [Todd] comes up to [Nurse Joy] with one of the two [Meowth] that got hurt in the [Explosion]. The [Meowth] then talks, revealing that it is [[Team Rocket]'s [Meowth]]. Meanwhile, as [Jessie] and [James] vow revenge on [Ash] and his friends, they quickly discover that they ended up with the wrong [Meowth].


[Ash], [Misty], [Brock] and [Todd] are taking a break in the middle of a city when they see a commercial for a [Pokémon] breeding center. Thinking it might be an interesting place to visit, they head off to locate it. [Misty] decides to drop off her [Psyduck] at the breeding center in order to get its eyes fixed. [Ash] believes that [Misty] is planning on leaving the [Pokémon] at the center, but she tells him that no matter how annoying it is, she'll keep it.
After leaving the breeding center, [Todd] notices a sign in a restaurant, advertising an all-you-can-eat meal for free. He believes that there is a catch, but the group heads in regardless. The owner tells the kids that he will give them a free meal if they can guess and show him his favorite [Pokémon]. Everyone releases all of their [Pokémon] (excluding [[Ash]'s [Charizard]]), but the owner tells them none are his favorite. He then pulls out a picture of a [Psyduck]. Shocked, [Misty] asks him if the restaurant will still be open later in the evening. The owner informs her that he will be, and the group heads back to the breeding center, only to find it closed. [Todd] tells her they could wait until tomorrow, but [Misty] angrily tells him she wants to get [Psyduck] then and there. Snooping around the back, they find a secret entrance and walks in.
[Misty] and the others are shocked to discover all the [Pokémon] in cages. They also find a conveyor belt leading into another room. Unknown to them, [Butch] and [Cassidy] are in the other room deciding on which [Pokémon] to give to [Giovanni]. [Todd] takes pictures of the fake breeding center and the cages as evidence, but [Butch] and [Cassidy] see the flash, however, [Ash] and the others hide, and when [Butch] comes to investigate, [Pikachu] uses an electric attack from inside one of the cages, making [Butch] think that the flash they saw was from [Pikachu]'s electric attack.
Then, [Jessie], [James], and [Meowth] arrive to steal the [Pokémon] (as [Giovanni] has not informed them that the breeding center was run by [Butch] and [Cassidy], as they might screw it up), and run into [Ash] and the gang, and mistakenly believe that they are also trying to steal the [Pokémon]. However, [Butch] and [Cassidy] catch them, and [Jessie] recognizes [Cassidy], though [James] doesn't. [Butch] and [Cassidy] do a [Team Rocket] motto. [Raticate] appears at the end of their motto. While they chase them around, [James] goes to pick up his [Weepinbell] that he left, only to discover that it has evolved into [Victreebel], and is constantly trying to eat his head. [Butch] and [Cassidy] trap [Ash], [Brock], [Todd], [Jessie], [James], [Meowth], and [Victreebel] in cages, leaving only [Misty], [Pikachu], and [Togepi], who escape.
[Butch] and [Cassidy] take [Todd]'s camera and frame him, [Ash], [Brock], [Jessie], [James], [Meowth], and [Victreebel] as burglars, and [Officer Jenny] arrests the seven of them. [Misty] goes back into the breeding center in disguise to get the camera, and [Pikachu] sneaks around and picks up the camera. Right when [Ash] and the others are put in jail, [Misty] shows [Officer Jenny] the pictures, and [Ash], [Brock], and [Todd] are cleared, and subsequently released. Together they move against [Butch] and [Cassidy], and [Pikachu] fries [Raticate] with a [Thunderbolt]. [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]] defeats [Butch] and [Cassidy] with its [Vine Whip], and both are tied up and hauled off to jail.
[Ash] and the others go to the buffet, and since they have [Psyduck] with them they get to eat their free meal. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] digs a tunnel out of jail. [Ash] and his friends reach a fork in the road. [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] go on to [Cinnabar Island] while [Todd] goes the other way, to the mountains so he can take some more pictures. As [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] walk along the road, [Jessie], [James], and [Meowth] are digging underneath them.


[Ash] and his friends take a boat ride, finally going to [Cinnabar Island]. However, once there, they meet [Gary] and his cheerleaders, who explain to them that [Cinnabar Island] is a tourist resort, and that [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] have not ventured to [Cinnabar Island] since the days of his grandfather. [Ash] then discovers that they, indeed, are on a cruise ship. Once on the island, they decide to find the [Cinnabar [Gym]], and thanks to a local (who tells them by using a riddle which [Misty] eventually solves), they do find it... only to learn that the [Gym] has been abandoned. The local tells them the story of how [Cinnabar Island] was once a hotspot for [Trainers], but then tourism took off due to the rise of hot springs resorts from the nearby volcano. The [Cinnabar Island] [[Gym] Leader], [Blaine], closed down his [Gym] due to being forced to battle tourists who had no interest in battling for [Badges]. The local leaves, but not before leaving a business card with [Ash] to an inn.
[Ash] and friends decide that, even if there isn't a [Gym], there is still a world-famous [Pokémon] [Lab] to explore. There, they too discover that it has been turned into a tourist trap. Finding nothing else to do, they decide to look for lodgings, but find that not only is the [[Pokémon] Center]'s lodgings full, all of the hot springs resorts have been fully booked, and they are left with no choice but to camp out. Even [Gary] has found himself a room, but unfortunately for him, his room entertainment is in the form of [Jigglypuff] (with [Hitmonlee] and [Electabuzz] dressed up in costumes playing the shamisen), who puts him, the audience, [Hitmonlee] and [Electabuzz] to sleep ([Ash] and his friends ran away before it could [Sing]). When [Brock] reminds [Ash] of the business card, they find that it also contains directions there... but in the form of a riddle. [Ash] and [Brock] are both stumped by it ("...you will see my hands, or at least my face"), but [Misty] guesses correctly again (that being a clock). The local, who runs the inn, not only has a vacancy, but allows [Ash] and company to stay for free.
However, before they can settle in, the local receives a phone call, informing him that the [Pokémon] [Lab], home to various [[Fighting]-type] [Pokémon], is under attack from a balloon. Figuring that [Team Rocket] is involved, [Ash] and his friends arrive at the scene, and quickly dispatch the balloon with help from [Pikachu] and [Pidgeotto] (via [Pikachu]'s [Thunderbolt] from the back of [Pidgeotto]). As a reward for helping to save the [Pokémon], the local reveals a secret: that [Blaine] had built a secret [Gym], in a place where "firefighters couldn't win".
Later that night, as [Ash] and his friends mull over the riddle in the hot springs, [Togepi] wanders off from [Misty] and jumps on a [Gyarados] statue, unwittingly activating a secret switch that moved a boulder, exposing a cave and knocking down the hot springs' gender divider. After quickly getting their clothes back on, [Ash] and friends explore the secret cave, and find a metal door that's hot to the touch. Beyond the door, they find a clear battlefield - [Blaine]'s secret [Gym], suspended over the [Cinnabar Island] volcano. The local suddenly appears, revealing himself to be [Blaine] (as [Misty] had figured out another riddle, the answer being the wig [Blaine] used as part of his disguise), and accepts [Ash]'s challenge.
The [Gym] Battle begins as a three-on-three battle. Confident that the [[Fire]-type] leader will use his [Fire] [Pokémon], [Ash] decides to lead off with [Squirtle], while [Blaine] counters with a [Ninetales]. Despite the type advantage, [Squirtle]'s [[Water] Gun] is no match for [Ninetales]'s [[Fire] Spin], and [Squirtle] is out in one shot. Deciding to fight fire with fire, [Ash] decides to use [Charizard] despite its obedience issues. In response, [Blaine] pulls [Ninetales] for [Rhydon]. However, [Charizard] simply flies off the battlefield as [Rhydon] was about to unleash [Horn Drill] and naps, unwilling to battle. [Blaine] then disqualifies [Charizard] for leaving the ring. Quickly down two [Pokémon], [Ash] decides to rely on [Pikachu]. [Pikachu]'s [Thunderbolt] does not faze [Rhydon] at all, but [Ash] decides to take advantage of using [Rhydon]'s horn as a lightning rod, and another well-aimed [Thunderbolt] at the horn knocks it out. However, [Blaine] isn't fazed, calling out his signature [Pokémon], [Magmar]. [Pikachu]'s electric attacks do not seem to faze him, which, as [Brock] explains, is due to [Magmar] using its own body heat as a thermal lance, diffusing the electricity. With [Pikachu] effectively unable to attack, and [Magmar] slowly wearing [Pikachu] out with a series of [[Fire] Punches], the episode ends on a cliffhanger, as [Pikachu] finds himself facing down [Magmar]'s [[Fire] Blast], while about to back into the lava. Will [Pikachu] survive?


When we last saw [Ash], he was locked into battle against [Blaine], down two [Pokémon] before [Pikachu] had managed to knock out [Blaine]'s [Rhydon]. However, any semblance of a comeback was halted by [[Blaine]'s [Magmar]], who quickly cornered off [Pikachu] and was about to finish him off with a [[Fire] Blast]. [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to duck in the last second, hoping to avoid the blast, but [Pikachu] is hit, but fortunately is not knocked into the lava, having hung on to the edge. Though [Pikachu] makes it back onto the battlefield, [Ash] concedes the match, not wanting to risk [Pikachu] falling into the lava. [Blaine] allows [Ash] to stay, as the hot springs will help heal [Pikachu] from his burns. Though [Brock] and [Misty] advise [Ash] to leave for another [Gym], as [Blaine] was simply too powerful, [Ash] declares that he will not leave without a [Volcano [Badge]].
The next day, as [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] try to help [Pikachu], [Team Rocket] manages to sneak into the battlefield, in an attempt to steal [Magmar] by freezing him. Though it appears that their attempt is successful, [Magmar] simply melts the ice around it, which in turn causes [Team Rocket] to fire more freezing missiles at it. However, their over zealousness causes the battlefield walls to cave in, and [Ash], [Misty], [Brock], and [Blaine] arrive as [Team Rocket] is sent flying. With nowhere to run, and the volcano about to erupt due to the frozen ice causing fissures in the walls and ground (causing the battlefield in turn to sink into the lava), [Blaine] is forced to use [Magmar] to dam the volcano and prevent its eruption. [Ash] also tries to have [Charizard] to pitch in, but [Charizard] is unwilling to cooperate. However, after seeing [Magmar] throw rocks in an attempt to dam the volcano, [Charizard] decides to help, and [Onix], [Geodude], [Staryu], and [Squirtle] also pitch in (the latter two helping to cool off [Onix] and [Geodude]). [Pikachu] also makes an effort to help, while [Misty] is forced to rein in [Psyduck] and [Togepi] from helping, while [Ash] is forced to rein in [Jigglypuff] from putting everyone to sleep. Eventually, the volcano is dammed, leaving [Charizard] and [Magmar] with a desire to battle it out against each other.
As thanks, [Blaine] allows [Ash] a rematch for the [Volcano [Badge]]. But with the battlefield destroyed, [Ash] and [Blaine] agree to battle one-on-one on the summit of the volcano - [Blaine] with [Magmar], and [Ash] deciding to use [Charizard] after it shows a desire to battle (he had originally wanted to go with [Pikachu]). As the battle begins, both sides trade [Flamethrowers], and [Magmar] counters with a [[Fire] Blast], which [Charizard] digs in and manages to deflect. [Magmar] then proceeds to hit [Charizard] square in the gut with a [Skull Bash], pushing [Charizard] into a pillar. [Charizard] begins to fall towards the lava. [Charizard] recovers, and locks up with [Magmar]. [Magmar] then uses [Charizard]'s own momentum against it by flipping it over, and pushing the two into the lava. Although [Ash] calls foul, [Blaine] reminds him that "under the volcano" is still part of their agreed-upon battlefield. However, once the two emerge from the lava, [Charizard] is now the one with the upper hand, having used his flight ability to create an aerial [Submission] and finish off [Magmar] with [Seismic Toss]. Having won the battle, [Ash] proceeds to congratulate [Charizard] and return it, only to be blasted in the face with another [Flamethrower]. As it turns out, [Charizard] only obeyed [Ash] in order to fight [Magmar], and nothing more. Still, [Ash] had earned his [Volcano [Badge]], and leaves [Cinnabar Island].
Wondering where to go next, [Brock] suggests that they head to the [[Viridian] City] [Gym], which is a leading [Gym] where the best [Trainers] prepare for the [[Pokémon] League]. [Ash] was unaware of the fact that there was a [Gym] in [[Viridian] City] and asks [Misty] why she didn't tell him before. [Misty] replies that they were too busy arguing for her to remember. [Misty] can't recall why they were fighting and just as [Brock] was about to refresh her memory, [Ash] quickly declares to keep moving, only for [Misty] to remember about him owing her that bike...


[Ash] and his friends are running to catch the last ferry off [Cinnabar Island], and just as they are approaching the ferry, they collide with a [Wartortle]. It tries to tell them something, but they do not understand. [Ash] sends out his [Squirtle], who begins to talk to [Wartortle], in a serious and urgent manner. Suddenly, [Squirtle] gets a shocked look on its face, and pulls out its [[Squirtle] Squad] sunglasses, putting them on. [Wartortle] and [[Ash]'s [Squirtle]] dive into the water, along with [Misty]'s [Pokémon] pulling the trio along in a boat, who lead them to an island in the shape of [Squirtle]'s shell.
They find [Wartortle] and [Squirtle] inside their shells on the island, who upon closer inspection, [Brock] realizes that they are asleep. As they look farther up, there is a giant shell, which [Ash]'s [Pokédex] reveals that it is a [Blastoise]. [Ash] and [Squirtle] check out [Blastoise], and suddenly they fall sleep. [Misty] and [Brock] try to wake him up, but to no avail. Then, [Misty] tells [Pikachu] to "try an electric shock alarm clock", which manages to wake [Ash] and all of the [Pokémon] up. [Misty] and [Brock] asked [Ash] what happened, who then replies that when he approached [Blastoise], he heard mysterious music that was vaguely familiar that caused him to fall asleep. [Misty] and [Brock] look at each other as if they recognize the cause, and [Misty] says that they should go ahead and leave, to which [Ash] replies, "Not until we help wake up [Blastoise]!". [Misty], shaking her head and smiling, says that she was afraid of that.
[Brock] begins to tell the story from the [Squirtle] and [Wartortle]'s point of view, with little pictures to illustrate it. "This island is the kingdom for turtle [Pokémon], who live under the rule of [Blastoise], the turtle [Pokémon] king." The [Squirtle] and [Wartortle] agree. "A few days ago, [Blastoise] went to take a swim in the ocean, but then it didn't swim back home. You found [Blastoise] floating in the ocean, but when you dragged it ashore, you all wound up inside your shells too!" He leads off saying that when a [Wartortle] returned to find everyone inside their shells, it headed to the main land to get help, and bumped into us. [Misty] comments on how people have been searching for the [Wartortle]'s breeding grounds for years, and here it is. [Brock] says that if it's true, imagine what things he could learn about breeding from being here. He puts on a doctor's outfit, and says that it is time for [Blastoise]'s first annual physical.
He pulls out a stethoscope and then they try to wake up [Blastoise]. Everyone tries to wake it up, but it eventually wakes up on its own, when [Blastoise]'s head and limbs pop out, lifting [Ash] into the air. He hops off, and then [Blastoise]'s cannons pop out of its shell. [Squirtle] then notices something stuck in one of [Blastoise]'s hydro cannons. It is squishy and pink, and then its ear sticks out. [Misty] and [Brock] suddenly realizes what it is, and [Misty] tells [Ash] to get that thing as far away from her as possible. [Ash] looks at her and asks how bad it could be. Then [Misty] and [Brock] know it's [Jigglypuff]. Then [Jigglypuff]'s song starts again and everyone falls asleep.
[Team Rocket] intrudes on the island, hoping to catch [Blastoise], but [Meowth], the one who went to get [Blastoise], falls asleep. Using the rope they attached to him, [Jessie] and [James] reeled him in, and throw him back. They then use their [Gyarados] grabber. They successfully escape, until they hear the noise coming out of [Blastoise]'s shell. They begin to sink into the water but all the [Squirtle] and [Wartortle] save them. Back on the island, [Team Rocket] chase the [Squirtle] and [Wartortle] around, and so [[Ash]'s [Squirtle]] and [Pikachu] try to wake up [Blastoise]. They succeed, and [Jigglypuff] what pops out. [Jigglypuff] is blown away into the [[Mecha] [Gyarados]]. [Blastoise] successfully drives off [Team Rocket], except [Jigglypuff] is still inside, luckily [Jigglypuff] is blasted out and lands on the island. [Jigglypuff] sings, everyone sleeps, everyone gets scribbled on. [Misty] is annoyed because the marker scribbling makes her look like a cartoon character. [Ash] breaks the fourth wall by chiming in, "Like that could ever happen!". In the end, [Ash] and his friends finally leave. Likewise [Team Rocket] is trapped on the wreck of their [[Mecha] [Gyarados]], with designs similar to the marker scribblings made by [Jigglypuff].


While in [[Viridian] City], [[Misty]'s [Horsea]], swimming in a fountain looks ill. [Brock] suggests that it needs to find a bigger pool to swim in, and so, the gang decides to head for [Misty]'s home town, [Cerulean City]. When they get there, they discover that [Misty]'s sisters at the [Cerulean [Gym]] are having trouble attracting crowds to their performances and have advertised [Misty] to be in a new performance called the "Underwater Ballet." [Misty] is reluctant to be a part of this at first, but finally agrees after much begging from her sisters. They then celebrate.
The whole [Gym] fills up with people eager to see the show. [Ash] and [Brock] are sitting among the audience, and [Ash] is excited to see [Misty]. The show starts smoothly with [Misty] swimming with the water [Pokémon]. While [Lily] and [Violet] (in costume) are watching [Team Rocket] attacks them and replaces them to be the antagonists of the show. [Daisy], who had been taking tickets, hears her cue on the pre-recorded voiceover and goes to change. [Ash] and [Brock] rush past them to help [Misty]. Confused at this, [Daisy] hears banging on a nearby locker, and finds [Lily] and [Violet] bound and gagged. An underwater battle commence between [Misty]'s and [Ash]'s water [Pokémon] and [[Jessie]'s [Arbok]]. Despite being outnumbered, [Arbok] is able to defend itself against [Horsea], Seaking, [Squirtle] and [Starmie].
The battle continues and the audience are completely convinced that it's all part of the show and are practically enjoying it. Although [Weezing] floats to the surface, unable to be underwater, [Arbok] dominates its opponents and rounds them up, looking to finish them off. As it looks like [Arbok] has won, [Seel] fights well against [Arbok] and eventually evolves into [Dewgong] to freeze [Team Rocket] in ice. After [Misty] and [Brock] pull out the [Water] [Pokémon], [Pikachu] electrocutes the water, sending [Jessie], [James], and [Arbok] upwards, hitting [Meowth] and the balloon, sending them blasting off once more. The crowd goes wild, an obvious fact that they enjoyed the show. Because of this, the [Cerulean [Gym]] shows are popular again.
Before departing, [Misty] decides to leave [Horsea] in the [Gym], and her sisters also borrow her [Starmie]. They also want [Togepi] and [Pikachu] as well, but [Misty] and [Ash] refuse to hand them over, but [Misty] offers to let them have [Psyduck], which the sisters say they aren't that desperate for. After all that, [Ash] and his friends bid farewell to the Sensational Sisters to continue their journey. As they leave [Cerulean City], [Ash] says that [Misty] was pretty amazing back there, but [Misty] reminds him that he still owes her a bike.


[Jigglypuff] sings its song in the woods, putting a [Pidgey] and a [Caterpie] to sleep. After scribbling on their faces, it sees a [UFO] land. [Jigglypuff] walks over to it to see some [Clefairy] get out.
[Ash], [Misty], [Brock], [Pikachu], and [Togepi] are eating ice cream when a [Clefairy] walks up to them. They chase [Clefairy], but while they are gone, more [Clefairy] steal their ice cream and backpacks. When [Ash] and his friends go to [Officer Jenny], they discover that many others have been robbed as well. A man named [Oswald] believes this to be the work of aliens.
While searching for the aliens, they see a [UFO] land in front of them. Two aliens come out and abduct [Pikachu], but they are really [Jessie] and [James] in disguise. They put [Pikachu] in a glass container that absorbs electricity into a lightbulb. The [UFO] is really being operated by [Meowth], using a crane. [Ash] summons his [Pidgeotto], which brings down the [UFO]. Before the battle with [Team Rocket] can continue, [Clefairy] appears, and [Oswald]'s scanner says that it is an alien. It says the same thing about [Jigglypuff] when it shows up. When the scanner says [Misty] is an alien (although it might really be reacting to [Togepi]), she knocks it out of his hand, breaking it. [Oswald] then says "You broke my scanner! It took me weeks to ensemble that scanner! What if I can't find the comic book I ordered it from?"
A [Clefairy] grabs [Pikachu] and runs off with him, still trapped in his shockproof container. [Ash], [Misty], [Brock], [Oswald], [Togepi], and [Jigglypuff] chase after it and go down a hole into an underground cave. There they see the [Clefairy] have been using their stolen items to build a spaceship attached to a rocket, and they plan to use [Pikachu]'s electricity to power it and make it blast off. [Ash], [Misty], [Oswald], [Togepi], and [Jigglypuff] enter while [Brock] goes back to tell [Officer Jenny]. [Team Rocket] also enters, intending to steal [Pikachu] and all the [Clefairy].
Inside the ship, [Jigglypuff] defeats all the [Clefairy] except for the leader, in the cockpit, where [Oswald] tries to pull a lever, but it breaks off. It turns out to be [Jigglypuff]'s microphone/marker, which [Jigglypuff] takes and then sings its song, putting everyone inside the ship to sleep. The ship is timed to take off, and does. The stolen items are all lost during takeoff, and are returned to their rightful owners. The rocket, with [Team Rocket] still aboard, detaches from the ship and falls. [Ash] finds [Pikachu], whose electric attacks are too powerful for his prison, shattering the glass. [Ash], [Misty], [Pikachu], and [Togepi] escape from the ship, using [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]]'s [Vine Whip] to grab onto a skyscraper as the ship goes into space.
Later, the [Clefairy]'s [UFO] returns and lands in a small village, where [Oswald] gets out, inside cardboard box with a helmet, as he believes himself to be on the [Clefairy]'s home planet. The [Clefairy] come out, and take more items from the inhabitants.
[Ash] and his friends continue their [Pokémon] journey, unaware that [Jigglypuff] is following them.


[Ash], [Brock], and [Misty] are walking through [[Viridian] City] heading to the [[Viridian] [Gym]]. As they stop outside its doors, [Ash] is all fired up to win his eighth and final [Badge] before he can compete in the [[Pokémon] League]. So fired up, in fact, that [Pikachu] lights a fire in front of him to mirror his feelings, accidentally setting [Ash]'s toe on fire in the process. After being chastised by [Misty], [Ash] excuses [Pikachu]'s actions. The group is then interrupted by the arrival of [Gary] along with his cheering squad. Once again [Gary] boasts that he is further along the path to the [[Pokémon] League], having already earned ten [Badges] compared to [Ash]'s seven. [Gary] heads into the [Gym] to challenge the [[Gym] Leader], followed by his cheering squad. [Ash] tries to follow [Gary], but is blocked by the guards, who will only permit one [Trainer] in the [Gym] at a time.
[Ash] is disappointed and depressed that [Gary] will still continue to get further and further ahead of him, and he crouches down in a corner to wallow in his misery. [Togepi] pats him on the head in attempt to comfort him. Thinking it is [Pikachu], [Ash] is so surprised when he sees [Togepi] that he launches it into the air. As [Togepi] flies up it bounces on a flag pole, catapulting it into the mouth of a startled [Fearow] who flies off with [Togepi] lodged in its throat. The trio set off after the [Fearow] searching for [Togepi].
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is perched high on top of a skyscraper searching for signs of [Pikachu]. As it flies over them the [Fearow] manages to dislodge [Togepi] sending it dropping down on top of [James]. [Jessie] tries to grab it but [Togepi] easily evades her wandering out onto a wooden plank linking the building to the one next to it. [Jessie] crawls out onto the plank after it but when she reaches the middle the plank breaks beneath her sending her plummeting to the street below. [James] and [Meowth] rush down the stairs to catch her but, despite making it down before her, miss the catch and she hits the ground. As [Jessie] picks herself up [Togepi] lands on her head, allowing her to grab it before collapsing once more.
The scene cuts to the interior of the [Gym] where [Gary], supported by his fans, challenges the [[Gym] Leader], who is shrouded in shadows, boasting that he is the best [Trainer] in [Pallet Town]. The Leader accepts his challenge, and his guards announce the battle will consist of three [Pokémon] with no time limit. [Gary] chooses [Nidoking] and the Leader responds by selecting [Golem]. The Leader commences with a [Tackle] attack, to which [Gary] responds in kind, ordering a [Tackle] from his [Nidoking], sending [Golem] flying backward to crash into the wall, defeated. The Leader then chooses [Kingler], and [Gary] consults his [Pokédex], which informs him that [Kingler] is the evolved form of [Krabby]. The Leader resumes with a [Crabhammer]. [Nidoking] dodges the attack, but [Gary] recalls him. [Gary] then chooses [Arcanine]. Ordering [Arcanine] to perform [Take Down] followed by [[Fire] Spin], [Kingler] is sent reeling amidst cheering from [Gary]'s fans. [Arcanine]'s [[Fire] Blast] is sufficient to beat [Kingler].
The Leader comes forward from the shadows, confidently announcing that he is not beaten yet, and he will use this battle to test his most powerful [Pokémon]. As he snaps his fingers, a door opens to reveal a [Pokémon] concealed by mechanical armor. Using its [Psychic] attack, it sends [Arcanine] crashing into a wall. [Gary]'s [Pokédex] shows only static when he tries to scan it, claiming that there is no available data on the new [Pokémon]. The Leader offers to allow [Gary] to use more than one [Pokémon] if he is afraid of losing. Despite protestations that he isn't afraid of anything, [Gary] sends both [Arcanine] and [Nidoking] forth to do battle. Even as they attack the mysterious [Pokémon] once again uses its [Psychic] powers to lift the pair from the ground. The Leader gloats that this [Pokémon] is invincible, and [Gary] is on the verge of panicking.
[Team Rocket] meet their boss, [Giovanni], revealing him to be the Leader of the [[Viridian] [Gym]], presenting [Togepi] to him for his approval. However, when he demands to know what it can do the team are at a loss to explain, causing [Giovanni] to lose his temper accusing them of total incompetence. They are allowed a brief reprieve when the phone on [Giovanni]'s desk rings calling him to deal with an accident, leaving [Jessie], [James] and [Meowth] in charge of the [Gym] giving them three [[Poké] Balls] to use if necessary. During the discussion, [Togepi] was able to escape through an open door.
[Giovanni] walks through a dungeon where the [Pokémon] he used earlier are kept in cages. Continuing to the last one he pulls a lever releasing the mystery [Pokémon] explaining that he has an emergency assignment for it.
Meanwhile, the three friends are still searching the city for [Togepi], as they meet back at the front of the [Gym] none of them have seen [Togepi] anywhere. However they hear [Togepi]'s voice coming from inside the [Gym]. Pulling open the heavy doors reveals not only [Togepi], but [Gary] and his fans lying unconscious on the ground. As [Ash] pulls [Gary] back to consciousness, [Gary] says that the mysterious [Pokémon] is not only powerful, it's evil as well, despite [Ash]'s assertion that there can't be an evil [Pokémon]. [Gary]'s fans are inconsolable, unable to believe that their hero lost a battle. As [Gary] announces that no one will ever beat the [Pokémon], [Team Rocket] appears and begins to recite their motto, however they are interrupted by [Ash], and his friends. To counter [Misty]'s claim that their motto is never any different they state that "today is very different" because they are now in charge of the [Gym] and the [Earth [Badge]]. When the trio demands to know why [Team Rocket] has a [Gym] [James] explains that [Team Rocket]'s plans are far too complex for them to understand before asking [Jessie] what they are, who [Meowth] reveals, doesn't know them either. [Jessie] then angrily sends [Meowth] flying.
[Jessie] raises two platforms on either side of the battlefield and invites [Ash] to take his place as the challenger on the green platform. Despite his friends warnings that [Team Rocket] have probably booby trapped the box, [Ash] ascends as [Jessie] calls the three [Pokémon] [Giovanni] gave her; [Machamp], [Kingler], and [Rhydon]. [Ash] calls out [Squirtle], and the battle begins. [Jessie] orders [Machamp] to use [Karate Chop], striking [Squirtle] many times. As the blows land, [Ash] is given a shock; the box turned out to be rigged so that the [Trainer] feels all the pain his [Pokémon] feels. [Ash] withdraws [Squirtle] and sends in [Bulbasaur], prompting [Jessie] to switch to [Kingler]. [Ash] orders [Bulbasaur] to use [Vine Whip] as [Jessie] orders [Kingler] to use [Harden]. [Bulbasaur]'s [Vine Whip] is rendered ineffective. Pressing the advantage, [Jessie] orders a [Bubble] attack, causing [Ash] to feel the pain as the [Water] move strikes [Bulbasaur].
[Gary] calls to [Ash] to give in, claiming the [Pokémon] are too strong, but [Ash] refuses to give up as he trusts his [Pokémon]. [Ash] calls out [Pidgeotto] and orders it to use [Quick Attack] which slams into [Rhydon], inflicting damage to it. Sparks of electricity starts crackling at [Jessie]'s feet which she notices. [Ash] then orders [Pidgeotto] to use [Double-Edge], which also slams into [Rhydon], causing more damage to it. Now [Jessie] is on the receiving end of the pain. [James] reveals that he rigged both sides, as it hadn't occurred to him that they might lose. [Meowth], on the other hand, planned for just such an eventuality, and reveals a remote control, which can cause either platform to explode. [Meowth] is about to press the button, but [Gary] tackles him, sending the remote flying. Seeing as they are now at a disadvantage, [Jessie] and [James] call on [Arbok] and [Weezing] to aid them. [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to attack, using his [Thunderbolt] to attack all the opposing [Pokémon] at once. This show of force sends [Machamp], [Rhydon] and [Kingler] running away, and [Weezing] and [Arbok] crashing into the equally shocked [Jessie]. [Ash] greets his [Pokémon] celebrating their hard won victory. [Gary]'s fans do a cheer in [Ash]'s honor, and even [Gary] is forced to admit that [Ash] is a pretty good [Trainer], although he still thinks [Ash], or anyone else for that matter, won't be able to beat the mystery [Pokémon] that he witnessed.
[Ash] approaches [Jessie] and demands the [Earth [Badge]] as proof of his victory, citing he earned it for beating her fair and square, but she refuses. As they argue, [Meowth] sees [Togepi] playing with the remote control. Despite [Meowth]'s protests, [Togepi] presses a button, forcing [Meowth] to reveal, far too late, that he had rigged both platforms to be able to explode. Sure enough, the trio's platform blows up, sending [Team Rocket] blasting off again, and the [Earth [Badge]] falling into [Ash]'s hands. They all are forced to flee as the [Gym] begins to collapse around them.
As the Trio continues their journey, [Brock] wonders if they will ever see the [Pokémon] [Gary] saw, while [Ash] is only interested in his eight [Badges] -- his ticket to the [[Pokémon] League]. Realizing that they don't know where the [[Pokémon] League] is, they decide to head for [Pallet Town] to consult with [Professor [Oak]].


[Ash] and his friends are getting closer and closer to [Pallet Town]. [Ash] is excited to get back, but just as he runs towards home, he crashes into a wall. The wall is completely invisible, created by a [Mr. Mime]. They look up to see a [Mr. Mime] climbing up the invisible wall. Just then, a girl named [Stella] from the circus shows up to try to catch [Mr. Mime]. [Ash] protests that he was going to catch it, but [Brock] holds him back because he thinks [Stella] is beautiful. This commotion causes the [Mr. Mime] to get away.
[Stella] then brings them to the circus, where she has her [Pokémon] perform tricks for the show. The star of the show is her own [Mr. Mime], but unfortunately it will no longer perform because of her harsh training towards it. So, when [Stella] shows her [Mr. Mime] to [Ash] and friends they see it sitting around lazily eating snacks. [Brock] tells [Stella] that he will get a [Mr. Mime] for her. When [Ash] is confused as to how [Brock] would catch the [Mr. Mime], [Brock] tells him that someone should dress up as [Mr. Mime] and perform in the circus with the hopes that [Stella]'s [Mr. Mime] will see this and get jealous. They hope it will lead to [Mr. Mime] wanting to perform in the circus once again.
At the same time, [Jessie], [James], and [Meowth] arrive at a [Team Rocket] building. Their boss is angry at them for the incident at the [[Viridian] [Gym]], but they hastily apologize and get away. As they sit in their balloon thinking of a way to get rare [Pokémon], a flyer for the [Pokémon] Circus flies by. They pick it up and start to think of a plan.
[Ash] ends up having to dress up as [Mr. Mime]. Since [Ash] doesn't know how to perform any of [Mr. Mime]'s tricks, [Stella] puts [Ash] into training before the show. [Ash] comes to find that her training is very harsh, and empathizes with the [Stella]'s [Mr. Mime]. Eventually, the circus show begins and [Ash], in the [Mr. Mime] costume, comes out and performs, which everyone falls for. Suddenly, the lights go off and [Team Rocket] comes in to steal the show. After performing their motto, they capture [Ash] and leave, thinking that he is a [Mr. Mime]. As [Team Rocket] sits and talks about how they are going to present "[Mr. Mime]" to the boss, [Ash] unties himself and reveals that it was him in a costume all along. While [Team Rocket] fumes about [Ash] always spoiling their plans, he then escapes and steals [[Team Rocket]'s [Meowth]] balloon. Needless to say, [Team Rocket] is upset and start to plan on getting the real [Mr. Mime] as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, [Ash]'s mom, [Delia], brings [Brock] and [Misty] to her house for lunch. Just as they are leaving, the [Mr. Mime] from the beginning comes knocking on the window. [Ash]'s mom thinks it's [Ash], and brings him in for a snack. The real [Ash] then arrives in the [Meowth] balloon he stole from [Team Rocket] and comes home. His mom realizes that it was a real [Mr. Mime], and then [Ash] asks [Mr. Mime] to help him. [Ash]'s mom asks [Mr. Mime] to help [Ash], offering him a big dessert if it helps, and it agrees.
Later, [Team Rocket] bursts out with a tank trying to steal the [Pokémon] from the circus. They fire nets at them and pin them all to the ground. The circus helpers get into their trucks and try to escape with the remaining [Pokémon], but they are trapped too. [Stella] and her [Mr. Mime] try to escape, but [Team Rocket] turns around and homes in on them. As they are about capture them too, [Ash] comes in to interfere, and he is reunited with his friends as well as his mom. He orders [Pikachu] to use [Thunderbolt] on the tank, but it has no effect, as [Team Rocket] anticipated [Ash]'s use of [Pikachu] and made sure the tank was largely made of rubber to ward off electric attacks. He then sends out [Charizard], but it doesn't obey him. [Ash]'s mom then tells her [Mr. Mime] to help, and it builds a wall to block them. [Stella]'s [Mr. Mime] sees this and, when the tank turns around, builds another wall to block them from the other side. Eventually surrounding them with a tower of walls, they try to blow the walls out with their missiles, but end up blasting themselves off again.
In the end, the wild [Mr. Mime] ends up going with [Delia] and becomes a helpful hand around the house. [Stella]'s [Mr. Mime] ends up forgiving her for her harsh training and agrees to perform in the circus again. [Stella] agrees to not train as harshly anymore.


The episode begins with a crowd of people cheering for our hero, [Ash]. He throws his [[Poké] Ball], happy to be competing in the Indigo League. However, upon throwing the ball, it comes right back at [Ash], becoming ever-so large. Fortunately for him, it was just a nightmare. Unfortunately, he wakes up with [Mr. Mime] using the vacuum to clean his face.
Giving a big yawn, [Ash] walks into the kitchen where his friends and mother are waiting for him. He tells his mother what had happened, to which she replies that he cleans whatever is dirty. [Misty] smirks and tells him it was okay to go another week without a bath. When [Ash] tells [Mr. Mime] to suck the smirk off [Misty]'s face, [Mr. Mime] does nothing. His mother claims that [Mr. Mime] only listens to her and has him go pick vegetables from the garden.
The episode then switches to [Team Rocket] walking down a dirt path to go back to [[Team Rocket] HQ]. They begin complaining about how they haven't successfully captured a single [Pokémon] for their [Boss]. Too afraid to see what [the [Boss]] would say, they quickly yell they quit before trying to run off. Before taking a few steps, the Headquarters explodes and a mysterious [Pokémon] flies out of the debris. [Team Rocket] turns around and run toward the Headquarters.
Once their boss sees them, he automatically assumed that they have more bad news for him. Frightened, [Jessie] and [Meowth] hide behind [James]. Before he can answer, a helicopter comes for [Giovanni]. [Jessie] asks if there is anything they can do, to which [Giovanni] replies that they can do their job for a change. He then boards the helicopter with his [Persian]. With renewed confidence, [Team Rocket] aspires to catch more [Pokémon], while [Meowth] mentions to go on with the show.
The episode then switches to [Professor [Oak]]'s laboratory. [Professor [Oak]] seems excited to see [Togepi].
[Ash] seems unhappy when he sees [Gary], his long-time childhood friend and bitter rival, and [Professor [Oak]]'s grandson. They both immediately begin to argue before [Professor [Oak]] tells them that the two top [Trainers] of [Pallet Town] should get along. Both are in disbelief that the other could be considered a 'top [Trainer].' Then [Krabby] walks over with a few drinks. Once [Gary] gets a look at [[Ash]'s [Krabby]], he doesn't think much of it. [Professor [Oak]] then goes on to talk about the other [Trainers] from [Pallet Town]. They were off to a great start, but couldn't cut it because of the lack of skills. [Professor [Oak]] said that [Gary] had ten [Badges], while [Ash] had eight.
[Ash], pumped about the [[Pokémon] League], tries to run off before [Gary] calls to him, asking him if he even knew where the League was going to take place. Of course, [Ash] has no idea because he came to find that out. [Professor [Oak]] tells him that the [[Pokémon] League] would be on top of [Indigo Plateau] in two months, and more than 200 [Trainers] would be competing. [Ash] figured that he'd beat them all, but [Gary] thought that he'd beat [Ash] either way.
The episode switches to a view of [Ash]'s house. A doorbell rings and [Ash]'s mom goes to answer it. [Team Rocket] is at the door, disguised as a news crew. They claim they are from PNN, [Pokémon] News Network for short, and they want to interview her son for a show called '[[Pokémon] Masters] of Tomorrow'. Upon asking if [Ash] is home, they are literally swept off their feet by [Mimey] doing his chores. [Delia] tells them that her son is with his friends at [Professor [Oak]]'s laboratory.
Going back to [Professor [Oak]]'s lab, [Gary] mocks [[Ash]'s [Krabby]] and shows off his own – a giant [Krabby]. He then goes on to say that he rotates his [Pokémon], and that [Ash] probably didn't. He also states that [Ash] probably uses the same [Pokémon] all the time. [Brock] asks what kind of [Pokémon] [Gary] would use against his [Geodude]. [Gary] says he'd use a [[Water]-type] and have a [[Grass]-type] as back-up, and asks [Ash] what kind of [Pokémon] he'd use. [Misty] then answers that [Ash] would use [Pikachu]. [Gary] mocks him, saying it'd be a bad move to match an [[Electric]-type] with a [[Rock]-type].
Finally, [Gary] asks him how many [Pokémon] he's captured. [Professor [Oak]] scans their [Pokédex], to find that [Gary] has seen only 60 [Pokémon], while [Ash] has seen more than 100. However, [Gary] captured way more [Pokémon] than [Ash] did. [Gary] then suggests to go see all of the [Pokémon] he's caught, and [Professor [Oak]] agrees.
Upon arriving at the lab where [Professor [Oak]] keeps all of the [Pokémon] from Pallet [Trainers], there seems to be thousands of [Pokémon]. [Ash] has his own shelf with his thirty [Tauros] [Safari Balls], and 2 [[Poké] Balls] belonging to [Krabby] and [Muk], respectively. [Gary] is then shown to have caught 200 [Pokémon], if more than one of the same types are included. [Gary] says that the more [Pokémon] a [Trainer] has, the better chance of winning. [Ash] retaliates, saying that [Gary]'s [Pokémon] are not his friends, and that being friends with [Pokémon] is more important.
[Professor [Oak]] goes on to explain that people have different personalities, thus different ways of caring for [Pokémon]. He also says that [Pokémon] needed to be respected and cared for like people. [Brock] asks if that was why he decided to take care of so many different [Pokémon]. [Professor [Oak]] tells them that is exactly the reason, because he wants to learn more about [Pokémon] and their mysteries.
The episode switches to [Team Rocket], out of their disguises. They take the back route to [Professor [Oak]]'s research field. By accident, [Jessie] kicks a pebble into a tree, knocking down [Kakuna]. In an instant, a swarm of [Beedrill] fly at them. [Team Rocket] make a break for it, only to slam into a [Snorlax].
Again, the episode goes back to the lab. [Professor [Oak]] explains his day, and says that he starts off by checking on all of the [Pokémon]'s health. He then decides which to let out of their [[Poké] Balls] and into a habitat built especially for that type, and feeds them breakfast. By the afternoon, he studies [Pokémon] and has recently been studying individual [Pokémon] of the same types. Then it is time for dinner and he puts the [Pokémon] back in their [[Poké] Balls].
As they walk through the field, a [Doduo] walks up to the gang. It is revealed to be [Gary]'s [Doduo]. [Professor [Oak]] then states that [Pokémon] frequently become more and more like their [Trainers]. [Ash] then says that [Misty] is more like [Psyduck], and [Brock] begins to go on about how, if [Suzie] still loves her [Vulpix], then [Suzie] loves him. After explaining that since [Muk] and [Krabby] usually stay with him, that they've become more like him, [Muk] rushes over and tackles [Professor [Oak]] to the ground.
The episode switches back to [Team Rocket] climbing rocks to get to [Professor [Oak]]'s lab after escaping the [Beedrill]. [Jessie] accidentally grabs hands with a [Geodude]. [Geodude] blushes, but is thrown away. When [Jessie] puts her hand back down, it lands atop of a [Sandshrew]'s head. [Sandshrew], unlike [Geodude], is angry and scratches [Jessie]'s face multiple times. Then it kicks off [Jessie]'s face and runs off. Suddenly, an angered [Onix] comes up from out of the ground and starts chasing [Team Rocket].
The episode then switches back to the gang. [Misty] is seen admiring the water [Pokémon]. [Ash] then compliments that [Professor [Oak]] must have all the kinds of [Pokémon] there are. [Professor [Oak]] disagrees and says that there are many more [Pokémon] not yet discovered. [Ash] thinks about it for a moment, and realizes that [Togepi] is a [Pokémon] no one ever saw before, and then he remembers the mysterious [Pokémon] he saw at the beginning of his journey.
[Ash] and [Gary] both agree that they want to catch as many [Pokémon] as they can. [Gary] then suggests a battle for practice. Before [Ash] can respond, there is an explosion at the far-end of the field, followed by some smoke. [Professor [Oak]] realizes it was coming from the electric [Pokémon] preserve. Upon arrival, they see that many [Voltorb] and [Electrode] have blown up because [Team Rocket] trotted onto their territory.
[Team Rocket] then tells them that they are there to steal [Pikachu]. [Gary] and [Professor [Oak]] are stunned to hear a talking [Meowth]. [Team Rocket] then does their motto. [Gary] challenges them to a fight, but before the fight begins, [Ash]'s thirty [Tauros] stampede at them, sending them blasting off. [Gary] then makes his departure, saying that he and [Ash] could have their battle at the [[Pokémon] League]. [Ash] agrees and says that he'd get working right away. [Professor [Oak]] makes him and his friends fix the fence [[Ash]'s [Tauros]] broke, first. [Ash] and his friends then begin working on the fence, knowing they'll have plenty of time to train. The [[Pokémon] League] isn't for two months.


[Ash]'s mom and his friends are going to go to the [[Seafoam] Islands]. [Misty] and [Brock] are going to go surfing. [Ash] goes to [Professor [Oak]]'s lab to discover that [Oak] is trying to find out why [Slowpoke] evolves into [Slowbro]. [Professor [Oak]] suggests that [Ash] go to the [[Seafoam] Islands] to meet [Professor Westwood V], the original creator of the [Pokédex] who would know the answer.
[Happy] to have an excuse to go to the beach, [Ash] and [Pikachu] head to the [[Seafoam] Islands]. [Ash] arrives and surprises [Brock] and [Misty], who are riding on sailboards. They walk to Westwood's lab and discover that he is actually the fifth of many Westwoods, and insists on being called that. He happens to also be trying to figure out the mystery of [Slowpoke] and [Shellder]. Westwood goes outside to fish, trying to understand [Slowpoke]. [Ash] and his friends examine [Slowpoke] sitting next to them. [Psyduck] comes out of its [[Poké] Ball] and talks to the [Slowpoke]. After what seems to be some random, unintelligent conversation, a [Krabby] comes out the water. It first grabs onto [Slowpoke]'s tail, and then [Psyduck]'s, leaving it in great pain jumping up and down. The team decides to go have some lunch for a break.
Meanwhile, [[Team Rocket]'s [Boss]] is taking a vacation on the beach and making [Jessie] and [James] dig for clams. Upset that they cannot take a break, [James] digs up a [Shellder] and decides to try to capture it. [James] calls out [Weezing] and defeats the [Shellder], but [Jessie] steps up to capture it. They go to the boss, but he is annoyed with them as usual. He orders them to steal all the [Pokémon] from Westwood's lab. The [Team Rocket] members arrive in a parasail and startle everyone, especially Professor Westwood, who tries to escape. They find that the only [Pokémon] Professor Westwood has is a [Slowpoke]. Westwood tries to run away with his [Slowpoke], but [Team Rocket] catches up and sends out the [Shellder] to make it evolve into [Slowbro]. They have a hard time with it, and it accidentally clamps onto [Psyduck]'s tail instead. [Jessie] gets mad and throws the [Shellder] again, but it clamps onto [Psyduck]'s head this time, giving it a major headache.
[Psyduck], now much more powerful because of its headache, uses [Disable] to stop everyone and causes [Team Rocket] to fly off into the distance with [Confusion]. As [Slowpoke] walks toward [Psyduck] to say thanks, it trips and [Shellder] clamps onto its tail, evolving it. [Team Rocket] runs back to grab [Slowbro], but it uses [Mega Punch], causing [Team Rocket] to blast off again. Westwood figures out why [Slowpoke] evolves, which is because both [Pokémon] benefit: [Shellder] balances [Slowpoke] so it can use [Mega Punch], and [Shellder] gains land transportation on [Slowpoke]'s tail. The episode ends as [Psyduck] goes to say goodbye to [Slowbro], though it only looks like meaningless conversation.


[Ash] and his friends, training for the [[Pokémon] League], are jogging on a cliff-side road. [Ash], decked out in his white and orange shirt, is ahead of [Misty] (in her blue suit) and [Brock] (in his basketball jersey). However, [Ash]'s progress has stopped when a truck passes by, spewing its exhaust in its wake. Blinded, [Ash] does not see that he is in the path of another truck heading in his direction. [Misty] and [Brock] look in horror as [Ash] is seemingly hit by the truck. Fortunately, the truck had swerved out of the way, leaving [Ash] unharmed, but it has created a large pileup behind him. [Officer Jenny] quickly arrives to defuse the volatile arguments caused by [Ash] and the drivers, who quickly speed off. As [Ash] wonders why the road would be so crowded, [Officer Jenny] tells them that it is the surfing season, and that the famous wave, Humungadunga, is coming. Surfers from all over have tried to ride the Humungadunga, which only appears once every 20 years, and plant their flag at the top of a rock, much like a famous surfer named Jan had done some 40 years ago.
[Ash] decides to also try surfing out, but his first go-around does not bode well. He wipes out often, and when on one occasion his foot cramps up, he is saved by an older man and his [Pikachu], whose tail glows before a wave arrives. As [Ash] recovers, [Misty] and [Brock] introduce him to [Victor] and his [Pikachu], [Puka], who had help saved him from drowning. As [Pikachu] meets [Puka] outside and watch the sea together, [Team Rocket], in the [Gyarados] submarine, plots to steal both.
In the mean time, [Victor]'s past is revealed: 40 years ago, he had been a young surfer, who had tried to emulate Jan. Although his skills were not good, Jan eventually took him under his wing, teaching him all about surfing. After Jan had conquered Humungadunga and planted his flag atop the rock, he had given his own surfboard to [Victor], simply saying "You can do it, too". With that, Jan had left to see the world. 20 years later, the Humungadunga had arrived, but he had failed. Discouraged, he was about to give up on surfing, but he then saw a [Pikachu] that had been cast away on a tiny raft.
This was when he first met [Puka], and since then, the two have worked as a team: [Puka] had the ability to sense the waves, emitting a bluish glow when a big wave had approached, and it had helped the two conquer many big waves on the island—Humungadunga was the only one that they have yet to conquer.
However, [Victor]'s reverie is interrupted by [Team Rocket], who have kidnapped both [Pikachu] and [Puka]. Diving down to make their getaway (with [Pikachu] straining to break himself and [Puka] out of their glass cage), [Team Rocket] encounter some real [Gyarados] in its mating season. The [Gyarados] is none too pleased, attacking the submarine and finishing off with a [Hyper Beam], causing the now-destroyed submarine to launch into the air and sending [Team Rocket] blasting off, but freeing [Pikachu] and [Puka].
Chasing after them on a boat, [Ash] manages to have [Bulbasaur] catch [Pikachu], but [Puka] falls into the water. [Victor] himself dives into the water, and using Jan's surfboard, manages to rescue [Puka]. However, the waves become more fierce, and [Brock] (now driving the boat) is forced to retreat before the boat capsizes, leaving [Victor] and [Puka] alone in the water. Just then, [Puka] begins to glow - a sign that Humungadunga is coming.
[Ash] and his friends are warned by [Officer Jenny] to evacuate the beach and stand as far back as possible. Worried about [Victor] and [Puka]'s safety from atop a nearby cliff, they are relieved when they find [Victor] and [Puka] riding the wave. As for the two, they manage to position themselves close to the rock, and manage to plant their flag atop the rock, next to Jan's. Back on shore, as [Ash] congratulates [Victor] for achieving his lifelong goal, [Victor] turns to a small group of young surfers, simply saying to them what he had been told so long ago: "Hey, you can do it, too."
As the episode closes, [Team Rocket] is seen being surrounded by [Gyarados], atop a rock with half of their submarine.


Back home at [Pallet Town], it's another day at the [Ketchum] residence. [Brock] is up making breakfast as [Ash] is awakened by a combination of [Mimey] sweeping over his head and [Pikachu] shocking him awake when [Mimey] does the same to [Pikachu]. This awakens [Misty], who was sleeping in [Ash]'s bunk. Later, during breakfast, [Delia] asks her son to help out with her garden (as he does not appear to be training for the [[Pokémon] League]), but the thought of that reminds him of some "serious training" that he needs to do in the mountains - something that is news to [Misty]. [Ash] tries to push [Misty] and [Brock] out the door as quickly as possible, telling them aside that laboring in the family garden would leave him too tired to train; at last, they run off when [Delia] tells them to get three-to-four hundred pounds of fertilizer from the [Xanadu Nursery].
After running away, they take a rest. They encounter a greenhouse, which [Ash] tells [Misty] and [Brock] is the [Xanadu Nursery], a childhood stomping ground. He recalls that the owner had moved away when he was a child and he does not know the new owner. When [Brock] peers inside and finds an attractive woman, all [Ash] sees is a [Gloom], making [Misty] believe both are hallucinating. They are interrupted by a gardener who wields a watering device that resembles a flamethrower.
Introducing himself as [Potter], he describes the [Xanadu Nursery] as a place which attracts [[Grass]-type] [Pokémon]. On hearing this, [Ash] sends [Bulbasaur] out to enjoy the place, as [Brock] inquires about the girl that he saw: he learns that she is named [Florinda] and is the new owner of the [Xanadu Nursery]. Just then, [Bulbasaur] sniffs a bunch of Stun Stem, a plant which produces pollen that can paralyze, much like [Stun [Spore]], which knocks it out cold. [Florinda] and [Gloom] appear, and [Florinda] advises [Ash] to take [Bulbasaur] with her for treatment. Thanks to [Gloom] (who has developed an immunity to Stun Stem by being exposed to it for so long), [Bulbasaur] recovers. As the two [Grass] [Pokémon] play, [Brock] and [Florinda] talk privately.
[Florinda] inherited the [Xanadu Nursery] (run by her family for generations), but she does not feel confident in her abilities because she is not able to make [Gloom] evolve, even with the help of a [Leaf Stone]. It is apparently not because of love, as [Gloom] is almost never gloomy. Just then, [Professor [Oak]] appears, revealing the [Leaf Stone] that [Florinda] has purchased to be a fake. As everyone tries to help [Florinda] cope with the situation, [Florinda] describes the three people who sold them the false [Leaf Stone]: [Team Rocket].
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] themselves are at the nursery, looking for the right [Pokémon] to steal. After encountering the Stun Stem, they decide to harvest it instead, as it could help them. Back upstairs, [Brock] swears to [Florinda] that he will find a real [Leaf Stone], but [Ash] dissuades him, reminding him that [Leaf Stones] are hard to come by. [Brock] instead swears to [Florinda] that he will find [Team Rocket] and bring justice, but [Ash] also points out that usually [Team Rocket] find them first. As if on cue, alarms sound, as [Potter] learns that plants are being stolen from the nursery. Sure enough, they discover [Team Rocket]. Though [Bulbasaur] manages to tie up the thieves, [Meowth], though he is a bit late, unleashes a bomb made of the stolen Stun Stem to incapacitate nearly everyone. With [Florinda] (who evaded the Stun Stem) and [Gloom] the only able-bodied defenders left, [Brock] urges [Florinda] to attack, as [Team Rocket] manages to steal the incapacitated [Pikachu]. [Jessie] and [James] send [Arbok] and [Weezing] to deal with [Gloom] and [Florinda] is surprised at [Gloom]'s battling ability when it uses [Double Team] to get [Arbok] and [Weezing] to hit each other. Meanwhile, [Pikachu] manages to bite [Jessie]'s arm, and frees itself, landing behind [Bulbasaur], as [Brock] continues to coach [Florinda], telling her that [Team Rocket] is now open to a more powerful attack. Though [Florinda] is not confident that [SolarBeam] will do the trick, [Gloom] sends [Team Rocket] flying with it.
Later, after everyone has been treated, [Florinda] thanks [Brock], noting that [Gloom] is strong as it is, and that it does not need to evolve. [Florinda] states that now she has the confidence to run the nursery with a special someone, which causes [Brock] to fall over. But when he recovers from fantasizing, he finds that [Florinda] has already proposed to [Potter], and that they plan to run the nursery together. [Brock] feeling rejected, [Ash] tries to console him, telling him that he will meet more women who will reject him. As [Ash] heads back to town with his friends, he is reminded that he has spent a day not training for the [[Pokémon] League].


[Ash] and his friends are at a campsite, training for the [[Pokémon] League], when they meet a [Trainer] named [Katrina]. Though [Brock] tries to make an advance, [Ash] quickly accepts an offer to battle against her [Raichu] with [Pikachu]. However, before the battle begins, [Team Rocket] suddenly appears with a net in an attempt to snag [Pikachu]. However, they end up catching [Raichu] in the net instead. After the realization that [Pikachu] had not been caught hit them, [Raichu] breaks free, and uses a [Thunderbolt] and [Mega Kick] to knock [Team Rocket] over. As they are preparing to send [Team Rocket] flying, a voice yells "[Cut]". It had turned out that during this entire exchange, they had unknowingly been filmed.
The producer introduces himself (in the style of [Team Rocket]'s motto, much to their bewilderment) as [[Cleavon] [Schpielbunk]], an acclaimed director. However, [Ash] and [Misty] had never heard of him, though [Brock] easily recognizes him as the producer behind his favorite movie, [I Saw What You Ate Last Tuesday] (which [Katrina] also admitted to "almost" have seen—implying that though his movies were critically acclaimed, they were hardly box-office successes). [Schpielbunk] is in the area to cast a [Pokémon] for his all-[Pokémon] production, [Pokémon] in Love, after his male lead, an [Abra], had teleported off the set over its costar, a [Wigglytuff] with a prima-donna attitude. Everyone is interested in being part of the movie, and sends out their [Pokémon] to audition: [Pikachu], [Raichu], [Arbok], [Weezing], [Meowth], [Vulpix], and [Psyduck] are chosen by their [Trainers] to audition ([Misty] originally wanted [Staryu] to audition, but once again, [Psyduck] pops out instead. [Misty] also had to rein in [Togepi] from walking onto the stage as well.), and easily pass though after showing off their dancing skills ([Pikachu] and [Raichu] dancing together in a ballroom-style dance, [Arbok] spinning about, [Weezing] and [Vulpix] by bouncing and jumping, [Psyduck] by wagging its tail, and [Meowth] from a tap-style routine).
In the next round, [Schpielbunk] wants the [Pokémon] to sing. However, as if on cue, [Jigglypuff] appears, and puts everyone to sleep. After waking up, [Schpielbunk] wants everyone to sing with [Wigglytuff]. When [Meowth] mentions to her that he "works alone", he and the other [Team Rocket] [Pokémon] are [DoubleSlapped]. As a result, an enraged [Team Rocket] fumes off in order to comfort their [Pokémon]. After the realization that show business is tough, if only because of [Wigglytuff] being irritable, [Pikachu], [Raichu], and [Vulpix] dejectedly leave the stage, leaving only [Psyduck] ([Misty] claiming it was too stupid to get off the stage), who gets the part (prompting [Brock] to claim that [Psyduck] was only acting stupid).
Later, [Brock] asks [Schpielbunk] for a plot summary of [Pokémon] in Love, to which [Schpielbunk] describes the movie as simply "brilliant". In his movie, [Psyduck] and [Wigglytuff] are lovers who are caught in a "family feud" between [Psyduck]'s fellow [Water] types and [Wigglytuff]'s [Normal] types. However, just as the movie reaches a climactic battle, ruffians ([Fighting] types) appear, and a stray arrow manages to hit [Psyduck], fatally wounding him. The family feud ends over [Wigglytuff]'s remorse over [Psyduck]'s death. While [Brock] is amazed at [Schpielbunk]'s brilliance, [Misty] claims that it isn't original at all (the premise being similar to that of [Romeo and Juliet]). However, [Ash] and company (including [Katrina]) agree to assist in any way that they can for the production. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket], nearby, is plotting their revenge for their [Pokémon]'s behalf.
[Schpielbunk] begins filming by shooting the climactic scene - so that he knows how the movie should end, he claims. The filming begins (with [Staryu] providing rain effects, [Pidgeotto] providing wind effects, and [Pikachu] and [Raichu] embedded among the large mass of [Normal] and [Water] types for thunder effects) as [Pikachu] and [Raichu] have their respective groups attack each other. However, as [Wigglytuff] and [Psyduck] prepare to enter the fray, [Pikachu] (in the middle of the fray) is thrown into [Wigglytuff], to which [Wigglytuff] responds adversely. Just then, smoke fills the area, and [Team Rocket] appear to have their revenge. However, this only causes all the [Pokémon] to turn their attention on [Team Rocket]. [Schpielbunk] then orders his crew to join the brawl that has ensued, while [Ash] and company take the opportunity to pose in front of the now-unattended camera.
[Katrina]'s scream, however, brings the group back to the brawl: [Team Rocket] had gotten the upper hand, and had, with the help of a large magnet on a crane, kidnapped all of the [Pokémon], except [Psyduck] (prompting [Misty] to say that it doesn't know the proper way to get kidnapped). As both [Misty] and [Wigglytuff] prompt [Psyduck] to take action, [Psyduck] manages to snap, and, in his brief moment of psychic powers, uses [Confusion] to free everyone and send [Team Rocket] flying. As [Psyduck] passes out from exhaustion, [Wigglytuff] comes over to him, concerned. [Ash] leads all the [Pokémon] to cheer for [Psyduck] as the scene ends.
That night, [Ash] is worried as another day is wasted from not training. [Brock] and [Misty] console him, though, as it is not every day he can take part in a movie, and he also met a rival [Trainer] ([Katrina]) in the process. [Schpielbunk] thinks that [Ash]'s adventures would be great movie material, and that any male lead would have plenty of female fans (to which [Brock] immediately tries to sign up for the role). The episode closes out with [Wigglytuff] and [Psyduck] alone by the lake, while [Team Rocket] is stuck in another precarious position.


Back home in [Pallet Town], [Ash], [Brock], and [Pikachu] are doing their morning exercises, while [Misty] remarks on how the TV remote is getting more exercise than the three. Just then, however, a special delivery arrives at the [Ketchum] residence, with four invitations to the [Hollywood] premiere of [Pokémon] in Love, the film that they had helped produce last episode. Although [Ash] is reluctant to abandon another day of training in order to go to [Hollywood], he eventually relents, and leaves for [Hollywood] along with [Misty], [Brock], and [Delia].
Elsewhere, while putting up a billboard for the movie, [Jessie] and [James] are thrilled about the premiere even though they were not invited, while [Meowth] is somewhat indifferent. [Meowth] then recalls his earliest memory: being alone at [Camp [Pokéhearst]]. As a young [Meowth], he was always hungry, once having been hung from a tree piñata-style for tipping over a basket of baseballs, believing it was food. While tied up, he saw a movie being premiered, called That Darn [Meowth]!, where he learned that [Hollywood] had ice cream and fried chicken, and he instantly decided to go there.
Meanwhile, [Ash] and his friends arrive in [Hollywood], but find themselves at a run-down section of town, far away from the glamorous core. [[Cleavon] [Schpielbunk]], the film's producer, suddenly appears and invites everyone inside. Across the street, [Team Rocket] are about to enter, seeing that the street is deserted, when [Meowth] suddenly decides to leave, promising [Jessie] and [James] to return before the start of the movie. [Meowth] arrives at an old run-down snack house, and recalls his first time there: back then, the snack stand was prosperous, and when he had tried to get food, he was caught stealing by the store owner, and in the ensuing chase, he had lost his food. Having eluded the chef, he was approached by a gang of [Meowth], led by a [Persian], and was accepted into the gang. Through the gang, he was able to satiate his hunger (by stealing the food he needed), but found that he was still missing some love in his life.
Coming to the boarded-up remains of what was once a posh department store, [Meowth] recalls the first time meeting his first crush, another [Meowth] named [Meowzie], at the window of that store. He recalls having dashed across the street to meet her (causing a major traffic pile-up in the process), only to be rebuked. Just as her owner had recalled her into her new diamond-encrusted [[Poké] Ball], she remarked at how, as a "street [Meowth]", that he would never win her over, as she lived in a life of luxury. [Meowth] vowed at that point to try to become human in order to impress her.
Back in the present day, [Meowth] comes across a run-down mansion, recalling his time there. Back in the day, the mansion was home to an academy that taught students upper-class etiquette. Through spying on one of the classrooms, he had learned, albeit slowly, how to walk - the drawback being that he got caught more often whenever he tried to steal food (having only to run on two legs instead of four). Eventually, he had also managed to speak human language, again from observing the classes. The first word he had understood was "rocket". At this point, [Meowth] breaks into song, believing that his new talents would win [Meowzie] over. However, when he returned to [Meowzie] to show off his talents, he was quickly dismissed as a "freak" - worse than a street [Meowth]. Angry over her rejection, [Meowth] set off to be the richest "freak" she ever saw, all to win her over. His journey eventually landed him at [Team Rocket], and the rest is history. As he finishes reminiscing, however, he is surrounded by his old gang, and he agrees to follow [Persian], which does not go unnoticed by [Jessie] and [James], who were about to enter the theater without him.
[Persian] proposes that [Meowth] rejoin the gang, believing that his human capability would be an asset. However, [Meowth] refuses, being loyal to [Team Rocket]. However, [Persian] brings forth [Meowzie], to the surprise of [Meowth]. Over a private conversation, [Meowzie] reveals that not long after [Meowth] had left, the city was caught in a recession. [Meowzie] was abandoned by her owner (who was moving away), unable to afford to keep her, and was taken in by the same [Meowth] gang. Believing that [Meowzie] is too good for this place, [Meowth] tries to take her away, but is stopped by the rest of the gang. But before they can take any action, [Jessie] and [James] appear, and while [Arbok] and [Weezing] deal with the other [Meowth], [Meowth] and [Persian] square off on the roof of a building. Although [Meowth] wins their brief battle, [Meowzie] runs over to [Persian], concerned about its safety. Stunned, [Meowth] wonders why [Meowzie] would not leave with him, and [Meowzie] replies that she had owed [Persian] her gratitude for taking her in... and the fact that to her, [Meowth] was still a freak. Dejected, [Team Rocket] leaves together, with [Jessie] and [James] trying to comfort [Meowth], saying that [Meowth] is still "their freak".
Back at the theater, the movie had ended. When [Schpielbunk] tries to gauge the reaction of the four, [Ash] complains that he did not see himself or his [Pokémon] in the final film (though [Delia] claims that she had seen a brief glimpse of [Pikachu]'s tail). [Schpielbunk] simply claims that, as the movie had an all-[Pokémon] cast, the scenes with humans in it simply had to be cut. [Misty] then wonders why they had even been invited in the first place (despite her [Psyduck] being in a leading role), with [Schpielbunk] simply stating that he couldn't get any real movie stars to attend their premiere. Just then, [Team Rocket] appears and does their motto, and promptly leave when they are asked why they are there, singing "Looks like [Team Rocket]'s dancing off again!".
The episode ends with [Meowth] on the roof of a nondescript building, staring at the full moon, still longing for [Meowzie].


With three weeks left until the [[Pokémon] League] competition [Ash] has fallen behind in training. On the couch of [Ash]'s home, [Ash] and [Brock] watch the [Elite Four]'s [Bruno] battling a [Trainer] with his [Hitmonchan]. As [Bruno] commands a [ThunderPunch], the TV is switched off. [Misty] chastises [Ash] for goofing off. [Ash] tells [Misty] they were studying the tape of [Bruno]. [Brock] adds that they were learning the 'powers of [Pokémon]' despite not knowing what those power were. [Ash] comments that [Bruno] could train him to learn the power. However [Brock] and [Misty] lament that the famous [Bruno] wouldn't waste his time with them. [Ash] confidently states that if they knew how to find him then [Bruno] would definitely teach him. Just then [Ash]'s mother enters telling the group that she knows where to find [Bruno]. Apparently [Bruno]'s secret training ground is on [Mt. Hideaway]. [Ash] jumps up and tells his mother not to make dinner as they are going up to [Mt. Hideaway].
Now on their way to the mountain, [Misty] tells the group that [Mt. Hideaway] appears to be only 7 miles away. [Ash] and [Brock], completely exhausted, convince [Misty] that she should rest. The group rest at a house where an old lady brings them food and drink. [Ash] asks her if she knows of a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] named [Bruno] training around the area. The old lady doesn't recognize the name but tells the trio that [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] have been stealing her meatball kebabs. As [Ash] and [Brock] eat, a bunch of windchimes start rattling. The lady angrily tells them that the thieves must be back again. Push broom in hand the lady runs out followed by [Ash] and company. They see three hermits running off with sacks in hand. The lady gives chase as [Ash] recognizes the bandits as [Team Rocket]. As they are about to start their motto, [Meowth] pulls out a remote and speeds it up, leaving [Jessie] and [James] exhausted. After this they tell [Ash] that because they always get beaten by him they have decided to become hermits and live off the land. [Meowth] adds they're also living off the old lady's meatball kebabs. The enraged old lady gives [Team Rocket] a beating with her broom and the troublesome trio run away leaving behind the kebabs. The lady tells the heroes that the mountain is known for overgrown [Onix]. Apparently the soil makes them grow larger. The lady assures them that, despite their size, the [Onix] are very gentle.
Continuing up the mountain, [Brock] comments that they have been walking for hours but haven't seen any sign of [Bruno] or any giant [Onix]. [Ash] notices what he thinks is a road. [Brock] says that it doesn't look like a road but more like tracks made by a really big creature. Suddenly an intense rumbling is heard and the heroes turn to see an enormous [Onix] heading their way. The [Onix] approaches as the three run for their lives. When it looks as if the [Onix] is about to crush them a man beckons them to jump behind a rock. The [Onix] goes by leaving them unharmed. The man asks if they are OK. The group turn to thank him and [Ash] and [Brock] are amazed by who they see. [Misty] doesn't recognize the man. [Brock] can't believe that the man standing before them is none other than the [Elite Four]'s [Bruno]. The three heroes are trailing [Bruno] up the mountain when [Bruno] asks if there is a reason why they are following him. [Brock] gets on his knees, and asks him to help [Ash] train for the [[Pokémon] League]. [Brock] motions for [Ash] to ask as well. [Ash] kneels also and ask for [Bruno]'s help. [Bruno] agrees to help them as long as they are willing to do everything he tells them to do.
Their first task is to carry buckets of water. [Brock] theorizes that the task is to make them physically strong. [Ash] adds that it also helps inner balance and outer equilibrium before falling and soaking [Misty]. Their second task is splitting wood. [Bruno] tells [Ash] this is to give him a firm grip. [Ash] chops the wood which sends a piece flying off in [Misty]'s direction hitting her in the face and knocking her off the rock she was sitting on. Task three is to carry heavy rocks up hill. [Bruno] tells them that this will teach them how to control their 'inner nature'. Finally [Bruno] asks [Ash] to peel the bark of a twig. [Ash] peels it perfectly. [Bruno] takes it and tells them the lesson is to always pack a fork when camping. [Bruno] breaks the twig in two and uses them as chopsticks. [Ash] is a little discouraged by this and [Misty] says she thinks all of [Bruno]'s lessons seem phony. [Brock] denies this and is ready to prove [Bruno] is a great [Trainer]. [Brock] says that he will sneak up behind him and hit him with a stick, claiming [Bruno] should sense [Brock] and stop the attack. [Brock] envisions him doing so and goes behind [Bruno] and attacks full force. [Bruno] fails to detect anything and [Brock] strikes him hard over the head leaving a large bruise.
As [Bruno] recovers from the incident, he asks [Brock] and [Ash] if they really want to know about the secrets of [Pokémon] training. [Brock] and [Ash] eagerly reply yes. [Bruno] tells them there are no such secrets and the reason he was on [Mt. Hideaway] was to catch the biggest [Onix] he could find. [Bruno] says that it's no secret that to be a strong [Trainer] you have to catch strong [Pokémon]. These revelations leave [Ash], [Brock] and [Misty] groaning. [Brock] is distraught that [Bruno] isn't who he thought he was. [Team Rocket] overhear the conversation and plan to catch a strong [Onix] so they can be as good as the [Elite Four] without having to do any [Pokémon] training.
Following the gigantic [Onix] tracks, [Meowth] believes that they have no hope of catching such a big [Pokémon]. [Jessie] and [James] reveal that they have an unexpected weapon to catch [Onix]. At the end of the [Onix] tracks in a large, open area [Team Rocket] set themselves in wait of the [Onix]. The ground begins rumbling as an enormous [Onix] bursts from underground. The [Onix] is much bigger than they were expecting and [Meowth] suggests they forget the idea. [Jessie] stubbornly says that they came for an [Onix] and that's what they would get.
[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] are heading back down the mountain when they hear a loud noise. They race off to the source of the sound. Meanwhile [Team Rocket] are blasting missiles at the giant [Onix]. The smoke clears and the [Onix] is completely unharmed and begins advancing on them. Terrified the three run into a nearby cave. The [Onix] begins tackling the wall of the cave causing it to start collapsing. [Team Rocket] are shouting for help as [Ash] and the others arrive. To save [Team Rocket], [Brock] sends out his [Onix] and [Misty] sends out her [Staryu]. [Ash] chooses [Squirtle]. [Brock] orders his [Onix] to use [Tackle], but it gets knocked back due to the size of the huge [Onix]. [Misty] tells [Staryu] to use [[Water] Gun] but it is largely ineffective. [Ash] orders [Squirtle] to use [[Water] Gun] too and the combined water attacks cause the [Onix] to recoil from the cave. [Team Rocket] use the opportunity to run for their lives. The wild [Onix] recovers from the double [[Water] Gun] attack and uses its tail to hit [Staryu] and [Squirtle] and [[Brock]'s [Onix]] before sending [Team Rocket] on their way. The [Onix] then notices the heroes standing on the ledge above. The [Onix] tackles the edge where they are standing causing [Ash] to lose his balance and fall into the area right in front of [Onix]. [Pikachu] jumps down and uses his [ThunderShock] attack. But [Onix] just shakes it off. [Pikachu] is about to try again before [Ash] grabs him telling [Pikachu] that electric attacks won't work. They huddle together awaiting [Onix]'s attack. But before [Onix] can strike a lightning fast [Bruno] leaps in and carries [Ash] and [Pikachu] to safety. [Bruno] looks down at the [Onix] which is thrashing around. [Ash] and [Brock] ask him what [Pokémon] and attack he will use. [Bruno] states that he will not use a [Pokémon].
[Bruno] jumps down and asks [Onix] why it is acting so violent. The [Onix] dives at him several times, but [Bruno] dodges its hits asking it why it is attacking him. [Bruno] then jumps on [Onix]'s head. [Onix] whips his tail around but misses [Bruno] and connects with its own head disorienting it. [Bruno] requests it not to be afraid of him and asks it to let him know what it is feeling. He closes his eyes and concentrates for some time. He then starts feeling around [Onix]'s body. Eventually he finds something between [Onix]'s rocks. Asking [Onix] to bear with the momentary pain, he strains before pulling out a [Sandslash]. The heroes are shocked and [Ash] checks it on his [Pokédex]. Apparently the [Sandslash] was irritating [Onix] the whole time and causing it to act aggressively. [Bruno] lets the [[Ground]-type] [Pokémon] go and asks [Onix] if it wants to come with him. [Onix] accepts and [Bruno] catches it in a [[Poké] Ball]. He jumps back up to [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock]. He then tells them the true secret is for [Pokémon] and humans to care for each other like [Ash] and [Pikachu]. Both of them look at each other and start laughing. [Bruno] farewells the trio telling [Ash] he looks forward to facing him in battle. [Ash] and [Pikachu] laugh together as they become one day closer to the [[Pokémon] League].


[Ash] is finally training for the [[Pokémon] League], and is battling [Brock]. [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] is battling [[Brock]'s [Vulpix]]. [Pikachu] is about to use [Thunderbolt], and [Vulpix] is about to use [Flamethrower], when [Jigglypuff] appears in-between them. At [Ash] and [Brock]'s command, [Pikachu] and [Vulpix] fire their attacks in a different direction, destroying a rock wall. As [Ash] and his friends walk closer, they see that they have uncovered the entrance to a temple, as well as a gigantic bell. They find an ancient artifact in the rubble, and an archaeologist named [Eve] takes it.
[Eve] and the other archaeologists are digging up artifacts related to the ancient city of [Pokémopolis], and a professor finds a spoon similar to the first artifact. [Pokémopolis] was destroyed in a storm a long time ago, and an ancient tablet reads that two great powers of destruction will fight and destroy the world, and no human knows the secret to stop them.
That night, [Team Rocket] attempts to steal the rare and valuable artifacts from the temple. [Jessie] has her [Arbok] enter the temple and bring back the most valuable thing it can find. It brings back a dark object that appears to be three dark orbs together. It absorbs [Arbok], and chases after [Team Rocket]. It makes footprints in the ground as it chases them, as though it is invisible. It absorbs them as well, offscreen.
Next day, the professor finds the dark device, and is absorbed by it. It then absorbs all the archaeologists except [Eve], and turns into a giant [Gengar] with strange markings on it. [Gengar] heads to the nearest town to destroy it. As the nearest town is [Pallet Town], [Ash] tries to stop it. [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] chase after it while [Eve] heads back to the van, where the artifacts are floating around. He sends [Pidgeotto] after it, but the [Gust] Attack doesn't do much, and [Pidgeotto] is absorbed by [Gengar]. [Brock] sends [Onix] after it and has [Onix] use [Bind], wrapping around [Gengar]'s leg, but [Gengar] absorbs it too.
[Gengar] chases [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] back to the van, where [Eve] is possessed by the two strange artifacts (the one that looks like a spoon and the other one with the same design), and the spoon sticks in the other one like a key, and the spell on [Eve] and the other artifacts is broken. The two artifacts then transform into a giant [Alakazam], also with strange markings on it. [Gengar] and [Alakazam] battle. [Alakazam] shoots energy waves that, when they hit the ground or a wall, transform into strangely-shaped stones. What those are is unknown. [Gengar] and [Alakazam] enter a beam struggle with [Night Shade] and [Psybeam] respectively, and where the beams collide, they shoot into the sky, threatening to destroy the entire planet.
[Ash] has his [Pikachu] use [Thunderbolt] on them when they step into the water, but although they are affected, no significant damage is caused to them. Then, [Jigglypuff] appears and sings its song. Everyone inside the giant [Gengar] falls asleep, but [Gengar] and [Alakazam] do not, as [Jigglypuff] is too small to put them to sleep. [Gengar] knocks [Alakazam] backward, and it crashes into [Jigglypuff], sending it flying into the distance, [Team Rocket] style.
However, [Jigglypuff]'s song makes the giant bell glow, and it summons forth a giant [Jigglypuff]. The giant [Jigglypuff]'s song is loud and powerful enough to put the giant [Gengar] and [Alakazam] to sleep, as well as [Ash], [Misty], [Brock], [Eve], [Pikachu], and [Togepi]. Just like the regular [Jigglypuff], the giant [Jigglypuff] gets angry when it sees that [Gengar] and [Alakazam] fell asleep, and pulls off the head of the bell, revealing it to be a paintbrush, and scribbles on [Gengar] and [Alakazam]'s faces.
When [Ash] and the others wake up, the dark clouds have vanished, as have the three giant [Pokémon]. The artifacts and all the giant [Gengar]'s victims have all reappeared. [Ash] walks up to [Team Rocket], and they decide not to battle [Ash] this time, and run off.
So the mystery of [Pokémopolis] has been solved, but the biggest mystery has yet to be solved - will [Ash] ever get to training for the [[Pokémon] League]?


The episode begins with [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] visiting [Professor [Oak]]'s [Lab] for some advice on training for the [[Pokémon] League]. [Oak] suggests that if [Ash] wants to compete that he get on his way immediately. [Ash] heads back to his house to get his bag and [Professor [Oak]] and [Ash]'s mom give him a heartfelt good luck as he sets on his way for the [[Pokémon] League]. [Brock] leads [Ash] and [Misty] through a grass field suggesting that it is a short cut to [Indigo Plateau], when a shadow suddenly flies by and jumps into the air. The shadow lands in front of them and is revealed to be a [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] named [Otoshi], who challenges [Ash] to a [Pokémon] battle, after he realizes that they are heading to the [[Pokémon] League]. However, he tells [Ash] that the loser must give up all eight of their [Badges] to the winner. [Ash] turns down the offer and starts heading back on his way when [Otoshi] suggests that [Ash] is afraid of losing to him. This tempts [Ash] into agreeing to the battle, despite [Brock] and [Misty]'s warnings.
The battle begins with [Otoshi]'s [Marowak] against [[Ash]'s [Bulbasaur]]. [Ash] looks up [Marowak] on his [Pokédex], which suggests that despite [Marowak]'s small size, [Marowak]'s strength is quite impressive. [Brock] warns [Ash] not to get caught off guard by [Marowak]'s strength. [Ash] commands [Bulbasaur] to use [Tackle] against [Marowak], which misses as [Marowak] dodges. [Ash] instructs [Bulbasaur] to use [Vine Whip] as [Otoshi] tells [Marowak] to use [Focus Energy] and then [Bone Club] to deflect the attack. Then [Marowak] rushes over and attacks [Bulbasaur], causing critical damage. [Ash] substitutes [Pikachu] for [Bulbasaur]. [Pikachu] rushes to [Marowak], but then [Marowak] starts continuously using [Bone Club] on [Pikachu], causing [Pikachu] to have to dodge the attacks. Then [Pikachu] jumps out and uses [[Thunder] Shock] against [Marowak], causing it to faint. 
[Otoshi] then begins to throw a fit over losing, and admits that he has no [Badges] to give. [Otoshi] admits that his [Badges] were stolen from him as he was walking to the [[Pokémon] League]. [Otoshi] and [Marowak] noticed some fruit on the ground. Being very hungry after much training, the pair rush over to eat, only to fall into a pit fall trap. It is revealed that [Team Rocket] took his [Badges] as he lay dazed in the pit.
[Ash] decides to help [Otoshi] get his [Badges] back, despite [Misty] and [Brock] warning him that they'll be late for the competition. [Ash] explains that he worked hard for his [Badges] and how terrible it would have been if he had lost his [Badges], that stealing from one person is like stealing from everyone. So, they all agree to work together in search of [Team Rocket] to retrieve the [Badges]. 
Meanwhile, [James] and [Meowth] are bragging to each other about how easy it was to steal [Otoshi]'s [Badges]. [James] suggests to [Meowth] they take one more look at the [Badges] when [Meowth] realizes that they're gone, along with [Jessie]. That's when [James] says that he remembers [Jessie] going off to shop with a big square package in a big green handkerchief. [Meowth] then figures out that [Jessie] must have stolen the stolen [Badges] from them.
[Jessie] is revealed to be heading toward the [[Pokémon] League] with the [Badges]. She decides to win the competition by herself, believing that she can be a solo superstar without sharing the glory with [James] and [Meowth]. 
Meanwhile, [[Ash]'s [Pidgeotto]] flies about searching for [Team Rocket], and appears to have noticed [Team Rocket]'s balloon flying upward with [James] and [Meowth] inside. [Ash] then instructs [Pidgeotto] to pop their balloon so that they can't get away. When they land, [Otoshi] commands [Team Rocket] to give up the [Badges], when [Meowth] admits that they have been robbed as well. 
[Misty] demands that they show them all that they own, just in case if they were lying. After they give a good search, [Brock] pronounces that it's all just junk. [Meowth] tells [Ash] and the gang that [Jessie] had stolen them. [Marowak] starts throwing a tantrum, and [Meowth] translates to [Otoshi] that [Marowak] doesn't want to be his [Pokémon] anymore, because of all of its hard work going to waste. When [Otoshi] asks [Marowak] to stay, the Bone Keeper [Pokémon] pushes [Otoshi] away and leaves him.
[Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] agree that they all have to find [Jessie] and the [Badges] or else [Marowak] may never come back. However, [James] and [Meowth] begin to give chase as well to find [Jessie] first. then [Jessie] is then revealed to have donned a disguise in order to fool [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock], [Otoshi], [James] and [Meowth].
[Jessie] spots a [Trainer] admiring his [Badges], and after seeing how pretty the [Badges] look, she begins thinking about taking them. Above [Jessie] and the [Trainer] are [James] and [Meowth] in the [Team Rocket] Balloon. [James] guesses that the woman beside the [Trainer] is [Jessie] by the style of clothing she is wearing. [Meowth] agrees and decides to land, right as [Jessie] attempts to steal the [Badges] of the other [Trainer]. [James] and [Meowth] then throw a smoke bomb at them. [James] begins to recite their motto, then [Jessie] joins in and the [Trainer] runs away after realizing that the woman is a member of [Team Rocket]. [James] declares from then on that [Team Rocket] shall steal as a team and not as individuals. 
That's when [Ash] and the gang arrive and demand that [Team Rocket] give the [Badges] back to [Otoshi]. [Jessie] tells [Otoshi] that she won't give the [Badges] back unless he can beat her in a [Pokémon] battle. The battle begins as [Jessie] sends out her [Arbok] and as [Otoshi] sends out his [Doduo].
Meanwhile, [Marowak] is walking through the woods and notices some [Trainers] and their [Pokémon] training for the [[Pokémon] League], which reminds it of the intense training it went through with [Otoshi]. [Marowak] then decides to go back to [Otoshi]'s side as his [Pokémon].
The battle between [Jessie] and [Otoshi] begins as [Doduo] runs over to [Arbok] and gets slammed by [Arbok]'s tail, and then by its head. Then [Doduo]'s heads begin to argue with each other leaving it wide open. [Arbok] then wraps itself around [Doduo] and squeezes it. [Jessie] attempts to catch [Otoshi]'s [Doduo] when a bone comes flying and stops [Jessie]'s [[Poké] Ball] mid-air. The bone is revealed to have come from [Marowak], who has returned to [Otoshi]. [[Jessie]'s [Arbok]] then comes over to attack. [Otoshi] commands [Marowak] to use [Focus Energy] as [Arbok] begins to use [Double-Edge]. Then, [Marowak] uses [Bone Club] and stops [Arbok] in its tracks. [Marowak] then uses [Bonemerang], sending [Arbok] flying towards [Team Rocket]. [James] sends out his [Weezing] in order to stop [Arbok] from colliding with them. However, [Ash] commands [Pikachu] to attack, so [Pikachu] jumps into the air and uses an electric attack on [Weezing] and [Arbok] sending them flying to [Team Rocket]'s Balloon as [Team Rocket] tries to retreat. [Otoshi] then commands his [Marowak] to use [Bonemerang] at the balloon sending [Team Rocket] blasting off. The [Badge] case then falls from the balloon and [Misty] catches it.
[Otoshi] walks over to [Marowak] asking it if it will battle in the [[Pokémon] League] by [Otoshi]'s side. [Marowak] accepts as [Misty] returns the [Badges] to [Otoshi] safe and sound. [Brock] congratulates [Ash] for doing the right thing by stopping and helping someone who really needed it, despite almost being late for the [[Pokémon] League].
Later, [Ash] and his friends notice [Indigo Plateau] up ahead and they all begin to run as their journey continues...


The episode begins as [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock] approach [Indigo Plateau]. [Ash] releases a loud cry of excitement which irritates the rest of the group and causes [Togepi] to cry...again. When [Misty] finishes calming [Togepi] down, [Ash] explains that he couldn't help himself, and that he is erupting in excitement for the [[Pokémon] League]. [Brock] suggests that [Ash] save the energy for his first match, but then [Ash] begins yelling again. [Misty] begins to worry about [Ash] being overconfident.
Later [Ash] and his friends approach a large fanfare and people with flags, and [Ash] thinks they are cheering for him. Turns out, they are all actually cheering on the Torch Bearer. The Torch Bearer is said to light up a huge flame that burns during the entire [[Pokémon] League] competition. The flame is supposed to be a form of inspiration for the competitors; [Misty] explains that the flame is supposed to be of a [Moltres]. [Ash] begins to dream about catching a [Moltres] and runs to the flame, exclaiming that he shall be the Torch Bearer.
[Ash] approaches the Torch Bearer explaining that he'd take the torch from there. [Officer Jenny] explains that only approved competitors can hold the Torch. [Ash] shows that he is a competitor with his [Badges] pinned to the inside of his shirt. Jenny tells [Ash] that he needs to be approved, when [Professor [Goodshow]] (on top of the vehicle behind Jenny and [Ash]) explains that they should bend the rules and let [Ash] be the Torch Bearer in honor of [Ash]'s spirit.
[Ash] asks [Mr. [Goodshow]] if he is [Santa Claus], causing the man to fall off the vehicle. Jenny introduces the man as "The Honorable [Charles [Goodshow]], President of the [[Pokémon] League] Torch Committee". [Goodshow] reexplains that the competition is about spirit, and that [Ash] would be the perfect man to hold the Torch. The previous torch bearer transfers the flame onto [Ash]'s unlit torch, [Ash] explains to [Pikachu] that the Torch is very valuable and shall be kept safe in [Ash]'s possession. [Goodshow] acknowledges [Ash]'s responsibility and so the Torch-lighting ceremony begins.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is in their balloon and plans to steal the torch, along with some [Pokémon]. As [Ash] and [Pikachu] run with the Torch, in the vehicle following him, [Misty] and [Brock] begin hearing a noise. Then, all of a sudden a fissure breaks the ground under the vehicle. [Ash] approaches the large sinkhole and is puzzling the cause, when [Team Rocket] begin to recite their motto from their balloon. Afterwards, [Team Rocket] jumps out of their balloon and [Meowth] lands on [Ash] and swipes him, causing [Ash] to let go of the Torch. [Meowth] catches the torch, but on the end with the flame causing him to catch on fire and throw the Torch away from him. Then [Pikachu] catches it as [Jessie] and [James] run away from a flaming [Meowth]. [James] sends out his [Victreebel] and commands it to bite [Meowth] to put out the flame. However, [Victreebel] then catches fire as well, and starts to chase [Jessie] and [James] along with [Meowth]. [Ash] sends out his [Squirtle] to put out [Jessie], [James], [Meowth], and [Victreebel]. Despite having been saved [Team Rocket] explains to [Ash] that they will not stop trying to get the Torch because it could sell for a huge price and get them lots of money. [James] jumps up and prepares to tackle [Pikachu] for the Torch. [Pikachu] throws the torch away and uses an electric attack on [James]. [Ash] and [Jessie] both go for the Torch, and both get their hands on it. They begin grappling and [Squirtle] leaps on [Jessie]'s face to help [Ash]. Meanwhile, [Meowth] jumps onto [Ash] and begins tickling him without mercy. [Jessie] catches it, [Team Rocket] makes some puns, and then they drift away. [Ash] is diminished, having lost the Great Torch. However, [Mr. [Goodshow]] rides on [Brock]'s shoulders out of the sinkhole and explains to [Ash] that all is not lost. He reveals a miniature lantern he carries around his neck at all times with a small flame from the fire of [Moltres]. The scene changes to [Team Rocket] in their balloon floating above a coastline. [Jessie] exclaims that the flame is about to go out. [Meowth] explains she just needed to turn it up, operating a small switch on the bottom of the Torch handle. This causes a massive flame to blast them all, also causing the flame to go completely out. They make some more puns and then they fall over in their balloon.
The scene opens with Jenny using a crane to pull her motorcycle out of the sinkhole, and then shows [Ash] using the lantern flame to light a new torch. [Ash] resumes running, and the Theme Song tune with new verses and exciting camera work follow. [Ash] is shown passing the flame to [Misty], who runs to the Theme Song tune with [Togepi] on her shoulder. Then we get an exciting close-up of [Misty], and the scene changes to a [Vulpix] close-up. The camera zooms to show that [Brock] is now running with the Torch. The stadium finally comes into view for the first time. [Brock] arrives and formally gives the flame to [Mr. [Goodshow]], who invites [Ash], [Brock], and [Misty] to the opening ceremonies, which will take place the following day. In the evening, [Ash] and Co. are mingling with [Trainers] when they meet up with [Gary]. As always he is surrounded by his cheerleaders, and is acting like somewhat of a jerk; they banter, and [Gary] exits.
The scene changes to night time over the town, and cuts to [Ash] lying awake, while [Misty] and [Brock] are sleeping peacefully. [Ash] has a flashback to [Gary] talking to him earlier that day, and one flashback of [Misty] and [Brock] worried about how excited he is towards the beginning of the episode. [Ash] declares them wrong and gets out of bed, going outside. [Misty] hears him and thinks he is scared. The scene cuts to [Mr. [Goodshow]] sitting on a bleacher in the stadium and [Ash] walking onto the stadium floor. Doubting thoughts go through [Ash]'s mind, but then he grows determined. The scene dramatically cuts to the opening ceremony of the [[Pokémon] League]. The competitors walk onto the field. [Ash] looks nervous. The last Torch Bearer is about to light the flame when [Team Rocket] disguised as League officials swipe the torch from her. [Weezing] uses [Smog], and [Jessie] lights the main flame. Then, [Team Rocket] head inside a robot and puts the [Moltres] Flame on its back. [Pikachu] attempts to electrocute the robot, but it resists electricity. [Team Rocket] attempts to incinerate [Ash] using the flame, but [Moltres] appears and obliterates [Team Rocket], blasting them off. The crowd seems unfazed by the terrorist attempt, and [Mr. [Goodshow]] gives a stirring speech. [Ash] inwardly thanks [Moltres] and the Commentator ends the episode.


With the opening ceremonies behind them, [Ash] and his friends begin to prepare for the [[Indigo Plateau] Conference]. After registering, [Ash] learns that he must first pass through four preliminary battles on four unique battlefields ([Grass], [Water], Ice, and [Rock]) to qualify for battling inside Indigo Stadium. The lady at the registry has [Ash] go through a random selection, and he is assigned to battle on the [Water] field later that day against a [Trainer] named [Mandi], who refers to himself as "[Mandi] the Astounding." 
Since he is assigned to the [Water] field, [Ash] plans to rely on [Squirtle] for the battle. [Misty] suggests that it might not be enough. The group runs into [Gary], who is battling on the Ice field, who mockingly wishes [Ash] luck as he wants to be the one to defeat him, and he walks away laughing with his cheerleaders. At that moment, [Ash] receives a call from [Professor [Oak]], who suggests he swap out one of his [Pokémon]. [Ash] decides to recall [Krabby] to boost his team. [Misty] is worried because [Ash] had never used [Krabby] before, but [Ash] is confident in the [Pokémon]. 
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is posing as a news crew to try to find rare [Pokémon] to steal. However, they were not having much luck. In one of their "Interviews", they come across [Mandi], whose cocky attitude makes [Jessie] angry enough to nearly blow their cover. Before she can make true on her words though, [James] and [Meowth] remind her of their mission and that they should keep their cover intact.
[Ash]'s battle on the [Water] field soon begins. [Misty] and [Brock] get special seats behind [Ash]'s podium on the battlefield to act as his coaches during the fights. After receiving a surprise good luck from [Team Rocket] from the commentary booth (which also leads to their arrest by all of [Kanto]'s [Officer Jennys]), [Ash] starts with [Krabby] right away, and [Mandi] uses an [Exeggutor]. [Krabby] jumps into the pool, but [Exeggutor] uses its [Psychic] ability to create a whirlpool, revealing [Krabby]'s hiding space. [Mandi] then orders an [[Egg] Bomb], knocking [Krabby] into the whirlpool and preventing it from using any attacks. [Ash] tries to recall [Krabby], but the whirlpool prevents him from doing so. Suddenly, [Krabby] escapes from the vortex, and [Ash] orders [Krabby] to use [Vice Grip] on [Exeggutor]'s leaves, stopping its attacks. Hanging on tightly, [Krabby] uses [Leer] to immobilize [Exeggutor] and uses a [Stomp] attack to knock it out. 
[Krabby] stands triumphant over [Exeggutor], and suddenly evolves into [Kingler]. [Mandi], still confident, sends out his second [Pokémon], a [Seadra]. [Seadra] uses [Agility] to dodge [Kingler]'s [[Water] Gun], but [Kingler] manages to slow it down with a [Bubble] attack and then knocks [Seadra] out of the fight with [Crabhammer].
[Mandi], undaunted, sends out his last [Pokémon], a [Golbat]. [Brock] worried that this could be bad for [Ash]; [Kingler] is weak against air attacks. [Misty] suggests [Ash] switch to [Pikachu], but [Ash] stands by his [Pokémon]. [Golbat] manages to evade [Kingler]'s attacks, dealing a great amount of damage in the process. But [Ash] remains firm and orders [Kingler] to use [Hyper Beam]. [Kingler]'s shot hit [Golbat] dead-on, knocking it out and winning [Ash] his first Indigo League victory.


[Ash] is in his second preliminary battle, on the [Rock] field. Both he and his opponent are down to their last [Pokémon]. [Ash] sends out [Squirtle], while the opponent sends out [Nidorino]. Both put up a fierce fight, but [Squirtle] manages to win with a [Skull Bash], allowing [Ash] to advance to the third round.
It is revealed that [Gary] was watching [Ash]'s battle with his cheerleaders. He says that [Ash] is acting like he won the whole competition after winning "two easy matches". He then says, "He better enjoy all his celebratin' now, 'cause when his luck runs out, [[Ash] [Ketchum]] won't have anything to cheer about. Unless he wants to cheer for me, right girls? Hah!" His cheerleaders chant his name happily at this. While he is speaking, he seems jealous and a bit spiteful toward [Ash].
[Ash] and his friends search for a [[Pokémon] Center] so [Ash] can heal his [Pokémon] before the third round. The centers are crowded and many [Nurse Joys] and [Jennies] are everywhere in the streets. [Brock]'s love meter skyrockets at this rate. [Team Rocket] relishes this opportunity to swipe [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]] and they do so by opening a fake [[Pokémon] Center]. After [Team Rocket] reveals their true identities to [Ash] and company, they are about to escape with [Ash]'s stolen [Pokémon], but [[Brock]'s [Onix]] stops them and gives [Ash] his [Pokémon] back. After biting open a hole in the balloon, [Onix] sends [Team Rocket] blasting off again! After fending off [Team Rocket], the group then hears that new [Pokémon] will be admitted into the [[Pokémon] Center]. [Ash] takes this opportunity to heal his [Pokémon].
[Ash] is now in the middle of the third round match with [Pete [Pebbleman]] in the Ice Field. Both [Trainers] each won the first round of the match. [Ash] uses [Kingler] for the battle, while Pete uses [Cloyster] for the battle. [Ash] tells [Kingler] to use [Crabhammer], while Pete orders [Cloyster] to use [Withdraw]. This doesn't look good for [Ash] since [Cloyster] used [Withdraw]. [Kingler] will get worn out from using [Crabhammer], but [Misty] and [Brock] encourage [Ash] to keep going, because [Cloyster] is still losing health despite the defense boost. [Kingler] keeps hitting [Cloyster] with its [Crabhammer] until [Cloyster]'s shell finally cracks, knocking it out. Pete recalls [Cloyster] and sends out [Arcanine]. [Kingler] tries a [Bubble] attack, but Pete's [Arcanine] dodges it and uses [Dragon [Rage]]. [Kingler] is defeated. [Ash] recalls [Kingler] and sends [Pikachu] into the battlefield. [Pikachu] uses [Agility], but [Arcanine] is trying to stop him with a [[Fire] Blast]. The [[Fire] Blast] attacks melt the field. [Pikachu] dives into the water, then uses [Thunderbolt]. Pete's [Arcanine] is defeated, and [Ash] is heading for the fourth round.


[Ash], [Pikachu], [Misty], and [Brock] are watching [[Gary] [Oak]]'s Round 4 match in the [Rock] Field. [Gary]'s [Nidoking] is pitted against [Melissa]'s [Golem]. [Nidoking] charges with a [Horn Attack], but [Golem] counters by grabbing on [Nidoking]'s horn, then uses [Seismic Toss]. [Nidoking] is defeated and [Gary] is out of the competition. Frustrated by the defeat, [Gary] heads home. [Ash] thinks that he's going to lose his Round 4 match on the [Grass] Field as well, and becomes nervous, but [Brock] and [Misty] cheer him on. He then later learns, thanks to [Professor [Oak]], that all of [Pallet Town] is cheering him on, which only makes him more nervous.
Meanwhile, [Jessie], [James] and [Meowth] have opened up a souvenir stand so they can make money, selling souvenirs and, when the souvenirs are sold out, fake [[Gym] [Badges]] which [Meowth] made from bottlecaps; but like always, their true intention is to steal the [Trainers]' [Pokémon].
At the [Grass] Field, [Ash] is getting ready for his next match with [Jeanette Fisher]. As always, [Brock] becomes lovestruck and starts to root for Jeanette. [Misty] admonishes [Brock] for that. [Ash] starts off with [Bulbasaur], and Jeanette uses [Beedrill]. The [[Bug]-type] [Pokémon] is about to hit [Bulbasaur] with [Poison Sting], but [Bulbasaur] dodges it. [Bulbasaur] uses [Razor Leaf], but [Beedrill] counters with [Twineedle]. [Bulbasaur] dodges the attack again. [Misty] is hoping Jeanette may not have more [Pokémon] like her [Beedrill], and [Brock] is hoping Jeanette doesn't have a boyfriend. [Misty] tells him, "There's no way that boyfriend is going to be you, mister, if that girl beats [Ash]!". [Ash] has [Bulbasaur] use [Leech Seed], draining away [Beedrill]'s energy. [Brock] becomes depressed that [Beedrill] is losing, but [Misty] angrily reminds him of who he should be rooting for. [Ash] then tells [Bulbasaur] to finish it off using [Tackle]. Jeanette's [Beedrill] faints and [Bulbasaur] wins.
Jeanette sends her next [Pokémon], [Scyther]. [Bulbasaur] launches a [Razor Leaf] at it, but [Scyther] uses [Double Team] to evade. [Scyther] gets in a few hits before [Ash] gets the idea to use [Vine Whip] on all the targets, so [Bulbasaur] will eventually hit the real one. The plan works, and [Scyther] is knocked out.
Unwavering, Jeanette sends out her last [Pokémon] - [Bellsprout]. [Ash] laughs at first, saying she must be desperate to use something so obviously weak. [Bulbasaur] uses a [Tackle] attack, but [Bellsprout] bends away in a wobble-like manner with ease, picks up [Bulbasaur], repeatedly slams him into the ground, and knocks [Bulbasaur] out.
[Ash] is shocked at this loss. [Brock] realizes that Jeanette's [Bellsprout] must be exceptionally trained, or else it would not be used in a League battle. 
[Ash] sends out [Pikachu] to try to fight. [Pikachu] uses [ThunderShock], but [Bellsprout] dodges the attack, and uses [Razor Leaf]. [Pikachu] was able to dodge and tries to use [Thunderbolt], but [Bellsprout]'s roots keep him ingrained and immune to electric attacks. [Pikachu] now tries to do some punching and kick-boxing but [Bellsprout] slams [Pikachu] & defeats him.
Down to his last [Pokémon], [Ash] pauses for a second and sends out... [Muk]. Both [Misty] and [Brock] are shocked that [Ash] recalled [Muk] from [Oak]'s lab as a backup [Pokémon]. [Muk] is able to absorb [Bellsprout]'s [Slam] and [Razor Leaf] attacks with ease, then uses a [Body [Slam]] (essentially smothering [Bellsprout]) to finish it off. 
[Ash] wins the battle, and has now cleared all four preliminary fields.


The episode starts with [Ash] and his friends going to get something to eat after [Ash]'s victory in the fourth round of the [[Indigo Plateau] Conference]. When they arrive at the restaurant they find [Ash]'s mom and [Professor [Oak]] standing outside. [Ash]'s mom then heads into the restaurant and begins to cook at the stove, while the cooks look on in confusion. After the food is done the group goes and sits down to eat and talk.
They all head into the elevator and as the doors begin to close a boy runs up, asking them to hold the elevator. He sees [Pikachu] and pets him on the head. [Ash] warns him that [Pikachu] might shock him, but to his surprise [Pikachu] is enjoying the experience. Suddenly, the power goes out and the elevator stops! The boy tells them that he can get it running again and asks [Ash] if he can use [Pikachu] for his [[Thunder] Shock] attack. [Ash] agrees, and the boy opens the device and lets [Pikachu] use [ThunderShock] on it. The lights in the elevator turn back on and the elevator begins to run again. [Professor [Oak]] remarks he's glad they opened the door for him.
Later on, [Team Rocket] decides to pull off another elaborate scheme: a "physical examination" of sorts. If [Trainers] do not comply, they will be disqualified. Unfortunately, when [Jessie] attempts to stuff [Pikachu] into a sack (getting shocked in the process), [James] lets slip [Jessie]'s name, causing [Ash] and [Ritchie] to realize who they were. [Team Rocket] performs their usual motto, and, behind the cover of [Weezing]'s [Smog], escape with the [[Poké] Balls] and [Pikachu]. [Ash] and [Ritchie] chase after them, cutting through the mountains to reach the escaping van. Suddenly, the come onto the road where the Rockets are traversing upon. When seeing the "twerps", [James] swerves off the road and down a hill and into a river. 
It's nighttime, and [Ash] and [Ritchie] still haven't confronted [Team Rocket]. They camp out, vowing to find their [Pokémon] at sun-up the following day. Meanwhile, the scene cuts to [Team Rocket] feasting by moonlight. After doing a "[Poké]-dance", the scene switches back to [Ash] and [Ritchie], staring up at the stars.
Morning arrives. The search continues, and the pair come across tire tracks. [Ash] and [Ritchie] follow the tracks, and discover the van along with the sleeping trio of Rockets. They creep through the camp towards the van, and find a muffled voice. It's [Pikachu]! They are reunited, and the [[Poké] Balls] are there too! However, [Team Rocket] has woken up and finds them trespassing. The quickly rush out of the van, lock the doors, and drive. Still in the van, the twin twerps must think of a way out... 
Finally, they remember that they were in a van with 100+ [[Poké] Balls] at their disposal. [Ritchie] identifies his [Pokémon] due to star-shaped stickers, but [Ash] sends out a [Drowzee], [Slowbro], and even a [Magikarp] before [Pikachu] sniffs out [Bulbasaur]'s [[Poké] Ball]. [Bulbasaur] uses [Tackle] and [Razor Leaf] on the van wall, but to no avail. [Ritchie] sends out his [Charmander] [Zippo] and orders it to [Slash] open the van wall. The tactic is successful, and the wall breaks to reveal [Team Rocket]. [Jessie] sends out [Arbok], which is matched by [Pikachu]. But before [Pikachu] lets loose a [Thunderbolt], [James] uses 'turn attack,' which causes [Pikachu] to lose balance. [Arbok] hits [Pikachu] back. [Ritchie] then sends out [Sparky], his own [Pikachu]! [Jessie] orders an attack, while [Sparky] and [Pikachu] both counter with [Agility]. [Arbok] is overwhelmed, and both [Electric] Mice [Thunderbolt] the van. The front portion explodes, leaving the heroes safe and sound. However, even in Anime Physics, inertia still applies, which means the back of the van is still driving along a mountain road- and off a cliff. [Pidgeotto] and [Happy] ([Ritchie]'s [Butterfree]) act as parachutes, catching their respective [Trainers] ([[Poké] Balls] and [Pikachu] included). After using [Whirlwind] to land safely, a group of SUVs (which turns out to be the [Trainers], plus [Brock] and [Misty]) pull up to claim their [Pokémon].
After they return, we leave off with [Ash] and [Ritchie] finding out that their next opponents are... each other!


After foiling one of [Team Rocket]'s heists in the last episode, [Ash] and [Ritchie] are battling against each other in the round five battle! [Brock], [Misty] and [Nurse Joy] think [Ash] is lucky he gets to battle a friend, and he and [Ritchie] vow to make it the best battle they've had. Unfortunately for [Ash], due to [Team Rocket]'s sneaky tricks, he becomes distracted on the way to the next battle. [Team Rocket] kidnaps [Ash] and demand that he either surrenders his [Pikachu] to them or be unable to battle [Ritchie] in Round five. [Ash] is trapped in the back of a truck, but manages to escape by flooding the entire truck with [Squirtle], and escapes when the truck runs over. [Team Rocket] returns, but [Ash] uses his [Bulbasaur] to defeat them. They return yet again, with bikes. [Pikachu] uses [ThunderShock] to paralyze them. They return a final time by hooking a crane on the bike [Ash] stole from them, and lifting him into the air. [Ash] takes out [Pidgeotto] to fly [Pikachu] up into their air balloon, where [Pikachu] uses [Thunderbolt] on them, and they drop into the forest. [Ash] orders [Pidgeotto] to fly the [Rocket Air Balloon] to the [Pokémon] stadium.
Meanwhile, [Ritchie] and everyone else is awaiting [Ash]'s arrival. Everybody is getting tired of waiting and the referee approaches [Ritchie] to inform him that as it appears that [Ash] is not going to turn up he is to be disqualified and [Ritchie] will win the match by default, but [Ritchie] begs the referee to wait. [Ritchie] tells the referee that he and [Ash] promised each other a great battle and that [Ash] must have a good reason for not being there but he is certain that his new friend will turn up. The referee, seeing that [Ritchie] is desperate that [Ash] not be disqualified, agrees to give [Ash] ten more minutes. [Misty], [Brock], [Delia] and [Professor [Oak]] are beginning to worry, but are proud of [Ritchie]. [Delia] and [Professor [Oak]] note that [Ash] certainly seems to choose his friends well. 
The ten minutes pass and there's still no sign of [Ash]. By now the referee has had enough and is about to disqualify [Ash] and award the match to [Ritchie] when suddenly [Ash] appears overhead in the [Meowth] balloon, certainly making quite an entrance. [Ash]'s friends are very relieved, while [Delia] shouts at her son to apologize for keeping everyone waiting while [Professor [Oak]] tries to calm her down. Unfortunately [Pidgeotto] is exhausted from flying the entire Balloon to the stadium, and [Ash] thanks it for all its effort. 
The battle between [Ash] and [Ritchie] finally begins with [Ash] using [Squirtle] and [Ritchie] using [Happy]. [Happy] defeats [Squirtle] easily with [[Sleep] Powder], and the ringer counts this as an elimination. [Ash] is truly surprised to see that [Pikachu] has enough energy to battle. [Pikachu] is at a disadvantage due to his lack of energy, but wins by using [Thunderbolt]. [Ritchie] sends out [Zippo], who uses multiple [Flamethrowers] that [Pikachu] dodges. Then, [Zippo] uses [Tackle], finally making [Pikachu] too weak to battle. [Ash] is left with only one [Pokémon] to use. [Ash] realizes he only has one choice, and it's a very risky one. He uses this one choice and sends out the disobedient [Charizard]. Everyone is shocked by [Ash]'s choice, especially [Brock] and [Misty], but to their surprise, [Charizard] battles after he is almost hit by [Zippo]'s [Flamethrower], by shooting a [Flamethrower] of his own. [Ritchie] recalls [Zippo], which immediately eliminates him. [Ritchie] sends out [Sparky], who is ready for anything. [Charizard] stomps on the ground twice, then uses his wings to create a strong wind that pushes back [Sparky]. However, now it is satisfied it could defeat [Sparky] if it wanted, lies down to take a nap. [Ash] is desperate and begins to beg, but [Charizard] clearly has no intention of moving for the trainer it doesn't respect. The referee declares [Charizard] as eliminated, giving [Ritchie] the victory. [Ash] is very upset, but manages to put a lid on his feelings in order to congratulate [Ritchie] and wish him luck. [Ash]'s friends are proud of him for his attitude, and later [Ash] stands alone in the empty stadium, knowing that regardless of his loss he has still learned a lot.


[Ash] is still upset that he lost his last match. He's been lying in his bed ever since, and his friends, mother, and [Professor [Oak]] are getting worried. [Misty] comments that he should be happy that he made it as far as he did and goes in to try to cheer him up. She offers to get him something to eat or take a walk, but he refuses. She tells him that she's only trying to help. They start to argue about how good a [Trainer] [Ash] really is when [Professor [Oak]] comes in. He tells [Ash] that he should have trained [Charizard] better. [Misty] and [Ash] start an argument again. [Pikachu], however, is having none of it, and he [ThunderShocks] everyone in the room.
[Ritchie]'s next battle is about to begin. He sits in a locker room and talks to his [Pokémon]. The door opens and in walk [Ash], [Misty], and [Brock]. They wish him luck and the battle begins. Brief battles are shown where [Zippo] battles against [Rhydon], [Happy] against [Venomoth] and a [Spearow] against a [Tentacool]. 
Both [Trainers] are fairly equally matched and they are soon both down to their last [Pokémon]. [Ritchie]'s opponent, [Assunta], sends out [Ivysaur] and [Ritchie] sends out [Sparky]. As soon as he pops out, [Sparky] gets a beating by [Ivysaur]. None of his [[Thunder] Shocks] are connecting. [Ivysaur] jumps into the air and unleashes a [Solar Beam], hurling [Sparky] to the ground. Just as he gets up, he is hit by [Ivysaur]'s [Tackle]. He struggles to get up again, but it is no use. [Assunta] wins. [Ritchie] runs up to his [Pikachu] and makes sure he's OK. In the stands, [Ash] and his friends are disappointed.
Later, [Ash] joins [Ritchie] near a lake. As their [Pikachu] play, they talk about their losses. [Ritchie] says that he would've trained harder if he'd known how tough the competition would be. He then comments on how losing is good for [Trainers], and [Ash] realizes how much of a baby he was. He and [Ritchie] promise to become [[Pokémon] Masters] no matter what.
Suddenly, both [Pikachu] fall into a hole. [Ritchie] and [Ash] run over to see what happened, and they too fall into a hole. [Team Rocket] appears at the surface and laughs at them. [Ash] tries to climb up the side, but slips down. When he lands, the bottom falls out and he and [Ritchie] plummet another few feet. [Team Rocket] uses a cage at the end of a fishing pole and pulls both of their [Pikachu] out of the hole. They try to shock them, but [James] tells them that the bars absorb electricity. They start to make their getaway when [Ash] and [Ritchie] rise out of the other hole, clinging to their [Pidgeotto] and [Butterfree] respectively.
[Ash] sends out [Bulbasaur], who tries to grab the cage with his vines. [James] sends [Weezing] for a [Smog] attack. [Pidgeotto] blows the gas back at [Team Rocket] with [Gust] and [Ritchie] sends out [Zippo]. After [Bulbasaur] frees [Pikachu] and [Sparky] with a [Razor Leaf], [Zippo] ignites the gas with a [Flamethrower].
As [Team Rocket] run around in pain, [Ash] has [Pikachu] and [Sparky] recharge the cage, he sends out [Squirtle] who extinguishes [Team Rocket] with [[Water] Gun]. Then [Ash] tosses the cage into their hands where it explodes, blasting [Team Rocket] into the air.
As the sun sets, [Ash] and [Ritchie] congratulate each other. [Brock] and [Misty] run up and invite him and [Ritchie] to dinner, after which they'll go to the closing ceremonies. Later that night, the closing ceremonies begin. Everyone marches back in, waving. [Mr. [Goodshow]] gives each and every one of them a special [[[Pokémon] League] [Badge]] for competing in the league. As this is going on, however, [Team Rocket] is digging a hole outside. They aim to dig under the field and steal the [Pokémon].
Back inside, the top three [Trainers] (who are shadowed) wave from the stage amid the cheers of the crowd. [Team Rocket] continues to dig as fireworks go off in the sky. [Meowth] listens at the ground above and tells [Jessie] and [James] to dig up. Unfortunately for them, a huge bomb falls through. It goes off and [Team Rocket] is blasted off again.
The next morning, all is quiet. [Ash] and [Ritchie] sit in the stands talking. Their [Pikachu] come running up to them and are warmly greeted. After [Ash] reminds him of their promise, [Ritchie] sets off. [Ash] remembers the highlights of the League games, all from when he saw [Moltres] at the opening ceremonies to when he lost to [Ritchie]. He gazes at the sky then he looks over and sees his friends, mom, and [Professor [Oak]]. Smiling he asks [Pikachu] if he's ready to go back to [Pallet Town]. He runs over to his friends. His first adventure has now ended, but his next one is just about to begin.


After [Ash]’s Top 16 achievement in the [[Indigo Plateau] Conference], [Pallet Town] holds a party celebrating his accomplishment at [[Professor [Oak]]'s [Laboratory]], hosted by the [Professor [Oak]] himself. A toast is held as everyone digs into the food. [Misty] suggests letting their [Pokémon] out to enjoy the food as well. [Brock], [Misty], and [Ash] bring out their parties, but [Ash]'s friends prevent him from bringing out [Charizard], knowing how unruly the Flame [Pokémon] can be.
[Team Rocket], in disguise, man a venue cooking food for the party. When [Ash] places an order, they decide to sabotage it with extremely hot sauces. [Ash] takes the food back as [Brock] and [Ash]’s [Pokémon] take the first bite. The piquance immediately takes a toll as [Brock] and [Ash]’s [Pokémon] fumble about, [Squirtle] unable to use its [[Water] Gun] (and looks as if it were using [Flamethrower]). [Misty] has [Staryu] cool them down. [Ash] laughs at their sensitivity to the spice, but he takes it back when he experiences the spicy meatball. 
During the confusion, [Team Rocket] takes [Pikachu] and runs back to their stand. As they recite their motto, the stand turns into a modified hot air balloon. [Ash] and his friends toss the food back at them before [Team Rocket] attempts to escape, with [Pikachu] hanging from the bottom. [Ash] has [Squirtle] attack, but the balloon is too high up. [Jessie] and [Meowth] shell the area with bombs, causing panic. [Ash] sends [Pidgeotto] after them, with a [Quick Attack] bursting the balloon. As they descend, [Meowth] triggers a secondary balloon to stop their fall. [Jessie] sends out [Arbok] to shoot down [Pidgeotto] with [Poison Sting]. [Ash] catches his [Pokémon] before it hits the ground. 
Furious, [Ash] decides to send out [Charizard] to get [Pikachu]. It appears to disobey him, instead taking notice of the food table nearby. Before [Charizard] can get anything, [Team Rocket] continues to bomb the area, destroying the table. Angry, [Charizard] races after them, deflecting another group of bombs back at the balloon, destroying it and sending [Team Rocket] blasting off. [Charizard] catches [Pikachu] from his free fall and flies back before torching [Ash] and showing off its power to the guests. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] lands in a tree. Something pecks at [Jessie] as [Meowth] points out a whole flock of [Pidgey] and [Pidgeotto] around them. [Jessie] tries to look beyond some trees, but a whole flock of [Spearow] led by a [Fearow] attack her.
Back at [Professor [Oak]]’s [Lab], the Professor finishes treating [Pidgeotto]’s wounds. Though [Ash] feels responsible for putting [Pidgeotto] at risk, his [Pokémon] doesn’t hold it against him and nudges him. [Misty] points out how [Charizard] is the opposite of [Pidgeotto], but [Ash] believes he will be able to control [Charizard] eventually.
[Professor [Oak]] then asks [Ash] and his friends to head to [Valencia Island] in the [Orange Archipelago] to visit his colleague, [Professor Ivy], to pick up a mysterious [[Poké] Ball] for him. It can’t be transported and his grandson [Gary] is currently occupied. [Misty] and [Brock] are inspired to put in some beach time, but [Ash] is more intrigued about the [[Poké] Ball]. Nonetheless, they all agree to head off, departing from [Ash]’s home.
As [Ash] and his friends head off into the forest, they become aware of the lack of activity in the forest. [Pikachu] looks up and alerts the group to a flock of [Spearow], ducking to avoid them as well as the [Fearow]. [Ash] scans with his [Pokédex] and wonders why they are attacking, remembering the [Spearow] he hit with a rock when he first started.
The [Fearow] swoops around and grabs [Ash] and [Pikachu], flying into the air. [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to use [ThunderShock], causing the [Fearow] to drop them into the forest. They land in the same tree that [Team Rocket] is unable to leave from. [Jessie] fills him in on the situation as he notices the [Pidgey] and [Pidgeotto]. [Misty] and [Brock] catch up to [Ash] as he plans to help the [Pidgey] family. [Ash] decides to get [Team Rocket] to safety first by jumping on the branches, getting the trio onto the ground. The [Spearow] chase [Team Rocket] away.
[Ash] tries to get the [Pidgey] and [Pidgeotto] to fly away, but they are still hesitant. [Ash] brings out his own [Pidgeotto] and has it lead them away. The [Flying] [Pokémon] start to soar away, when [Fearow] returns. [Ash]’s [Pidgeotto] challenges the [Fearow], but gets hit by [Fearow]’s [Tackle], sending it to the ground. [Ash] catches up to his hurt [Pokémon] as the [Fearow] begins to harass the other [Pidgey]. [Pidgeotto] struggles to get up, letting out a cry as it begins to evolve, completing its evolution to [Pidgeot]! [Ash] scans with his [Pokédex] as [Pidgeot] spreads its wings, wanting [Ash] to get on. [Pikachu] joins him as they soar after [Fearow]. [Fearow] turns around as [Pidgeot] fires multiple [Gust] attacks, hammering the [Fearow]. A [Quick Attack] follow-up easily strikes the [Fearow]. [Pikachu] then jumps onto the [Fearow] and launches a [Thunderbolt]. [Pikachu] gets back on with [Ash] as [Ash] attempts to catch it, but [Fearow] swats the Ball away and prepares to attack again, but the [Pidgey] and [Pidgeotto] team up with [Pidgeot] to assault [Fearow] with multiple attacks. Outnumbered, [Fearow] turns tail and flies away.
Back on the ground, as the sun sets, [Ash] decides to leave [Pidgeot] with the group to keep the [Pidgey] and [Pidgeotto] safe. [Pidgeot] flies away with the other bird [Pokémon], leading them away. [Ash] and his friends then continue their journey to [Valencia Island]. Meanwhile [Team Rocket] is still running away from the [Spearow]!


As they prepare to depart for [Valencia Island], [Ash] and his friends pick up supplies at a grocery store. [Ash] suggests walking to the island, but [Brock]'s guidebook says that it will only take less than a day traveling by blimp. While the blimp arrives, two men sponsor a contest where the winner gets a prize just by showing their store receipt to them. [Ash] shows his receipt, and wins a trip on the blimp. Unbeknownst to the kids, [Jessie] and [James] have received an assignment from [Giovanni] to operate the blimp.
[Ash] and the others reach the blimp yard and see a broken-down blimp. Two men approach them and ask if they are riding the blimp. They then say that the blimp is haunted and full of ghosts. At this point, [Jessie] and [James] enter the blimp.
Once on board, the group notices how deteriorated the blimp truly is. Meanwhile, [Meowth] fixes dinner as [Jessie] and [James] act as waiters. During some turbulence, [Ash] complains about the ride, so [Jessie] and [James] ask [Meowth] who's flying the blimp. To their shock, no one is, so the pair desperately commandeer the blimp, but instead fly it into a big storm.
Suddenly, [Misty] notices that [Togepi] is missing. They set out to find it, while [Team Rocket] starts looking for the twerps. When [Ash] and the others reach the inflated portion of the blimp, they encounter what they believe to be a ghost, but it is actually revealed to be [Jigglypuff].
Eventually, [Ash] and friends meet up with [Team Rocket] and begin a [Pokémon] battle. At one point, [[Brock]'s [Geodude]] throws [[James]'s [Weezing]] through the blimp, causing it to start ripping apart. [Misty] finally spots [Togepi] on a high ledge, so [Ash] has [Bulbasaur] try to grab [Togepi] from the ledge. [Team Rocket] take this opportunity and attempt to steal [Pikachu], but their plan is thwarted when the blimp hits a pocket of turbulence, forcing them to fall out of the aircraft. [Meowth] makes a parachute from some of the blimp's fabric, but [Jigglypuff] lands on top of it and starts to sing. They fall asleep, and [Meowth] lets go of the fabric, causing the trio to fall into the ocean and drift away.
[Ash] and the others rush to control the blimp and try to land it. Using their [Pokémon], they are able to steer the blimp and crash-land it on [Valencia Island]. Now safely on land, they continue to [Professor Ivy]'s lab to obtain the [GS Ball].


After the events in the previous episode, [Ash] and his friends managed to touch the blimp down on [Valencia Island]. As they walk, [Ash] finds the tropical heat exhausting. They get to an outlook and realize that they cannot find [Professor Ivy]'s lab. [Pikachu] points to what appears to be a [[Pokémon] Center]. They go inside and find [Nurse Joy], much like previous centers. [Nurse Joy] gives them directions to Ivy's lab. They get to the lab and go inside, finding it empty. A floor hatch opens and three girls greet them, leading the trio down to the beach. A [Gyarados] comes out of the sea as a woman pets it, shocking everyone by her skill. [Gyarados] takes her to the shore as one of the girls tosses her a lab coat. She introduces herself as [Professor Ivy]. 
Back at the lab, Ivy shows them the gold and silver ball. She reveals the inscribed letters on the top of the ball, giving it the name the [GS Ball]. One of the assistants demonstrates how the ball could not be transported. Ivy also points out how multiple attempts to open it have all failed. Ivy hands the ball over to [Ash] to deliver to [Professor [Oak]]. [Ash] calls [Oak] and shows him the [GS Ball]. Ivy takes the phone and the two professors talk, the scientific terminology baffling [Ash] and prompting him to cut the call short. 
At the airfield, [Meowth] looks in shock at the ruined blimp. Both [Meowth] and [James] believe the blimp is beyond repair, but [Jessie] smacks them and reminds them that [Ash] and his friends have a return trip booked. Knowing that it means getting another shot at catching [Pikachu], [Team Rocket] gets to work repairing the blimp.
Ivy leads [Ash] and the others throughout the outside environment, which serves as her lab. [Misty] smells the flowers, but a [Vileplume] steps out of the bushes. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] and notices the [Vileplume] has different color leaves. The assistants rush out a crate of [Pokémon] food as other [Pokémon] come out, all possessing different coloring than normal. Ivy attributes the difference to the tropical climate. [Brock] and the others are amazed at the varying [Pokémon] as [Pikachu] and [Togepi] take a sample of the food. [Ash] and [Misty] scold them, but attention quickly shifts when an assistant points out that the [Butterfree] has not eaten in days despite different food combinations. [Brock] samples the food before running off. He returns to smash berries, pointing out that the taste is important. He sprinkles the solution onto the food, and the [Butterfree] flies down immediately to eat. The professor is amazed at [Brock]'s skill. 
Back at the living quarters, everyone is shocked at the amount of disorder, the assistants referring to it as a little dump. [Brock] goes crazy at the need to clean, putting on his gear and going into a cleaning frenzy, making the place spotless and preparing an awesome dinner. The professor and the assistants jump into the food as [Brock] muses at the comparison to his family. Later that night, while everyone sleeps, [Professor Ivy] and the assistants watch [Vileplume] mark the area with their pollen. [Brock] meets with them and gives them a snack as he watches. The assistant notices a [Raticate] entering the pollen zone. Ivy rushes in to pull [Raticate] to safety, exposing herself to the pollen and weakening her. She orders the assistants to contact the [[Pokémon] Center]. At the center, Joy treats both [Raticate] and the Professor. Due to her actions, [Raticate] was not hurt very much and will recover. The assistants show their concerns to Ivy as [Brock] watches with admiration.
The next day, [Ash] and [Misty] prepare to leave, but they notice [Brock] is not with them. [[Brock]'s [Pokémon]] rush around with him as he fixes the roof. Ivy notes that [Brock] wants to stay. [Brock] explains that he can learn about [Pokémon] at the lab and that they need him more than [Ash] does. [Ash] agrees as they shake hands. [Ash] and [Misty] leave the lab and wave farewell to [Brock], [Professor Ivy], and her assistants.
As they walk, [Misty] notes how different it will be without [Brock] before bringing up the dilemma about getting back to [Pallet Town]. [Ash] brings out the blimp tickets as [Misty] mentions how the blimp was a disaster. When they get to the field, they find a brand new blimp on standby. A disguised [Team Rocket] whisks them aboard. The ship takes to the skies as [Jigglypuff] manages to get onboard. 
When [Ash] and [Misty] request food, [Team Rocket] steps out and drops a steel cage to imprison them before revealing themselves. They notice [Brock] is not with them and [James] cracks a joke about [Ash] and [Misty] being "a pair of very romantic creatures", with [Meowth] adding that [Ash] and [Misty] are lovebirds, which both of them blatantly deny. [Jessie] adds that they're both blushing. [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to attack, but [Jessie] warns that the attack will destroy the entire blimp. [Jigglypuff] jumps in and sings. [Team Rocket] quickly grabs parachutes and opens the hatch, flying out as well as [Jigglypuff]. [Misty] and [Ash] are stuck on the blimp without a pilot.


After the events of the previous episode, the blimp crash-lands on another island. The blimp turns onto its side in the explosion, overturning the cage and freeing [Ash] and [Misty]. As they exit the wreck, they scan the area, finding it apparently quiet. [Ash] and [Misty] hike for miles without coming across another person. [Misty] fears it’s a deserted island and they will have to eat bugs and berries. Suddenly, a group of elderly tourists walk by and pose with [Pikachu] and [Togepi]. [Ash] and [Misty] eventually find an exit, where two Hawaiian-style ladies in hula skirts put leis on the group. They find out that island isn’t deserted and that they were in [[Pokémon] Park] on [Tangelo Island]. 
They stroll along the beach city when [Pikachu] notices a [Lapras] on the beach. Three guys are verbally and physically abusing it, one hitting it with a stick. [Ash] and [Misty] confront the three guys, which quickly grows hostile as the guys reveal that they want the [Lapras] so they can use it to battle the [Orange Crew]. The three guys send out [Spearow], [Hitmonchan] and [Beedrill]. [Ash] pits [Pikachu] against all three while [Misty] hides [Togepi]. Before any attacks are launched, someone calls out for them to stop. He steps forward, measuring and sketching all the [Pokémon]. He quickly points out that [Spearow] is vitamin-deficient, [Beedrill]’s coloring is poor and [Hitmonchan] is lacking exercise. He contrasts the underdeveloped [Pokémon] with [Ash]’s [Pikachu], noting the shiny coat. The three guys get irritated and order all three [Pokémon] to attack, but [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] takes the three [Pokémon] down and sends them scurrying. However, the watcher quickly shifts his attention to the [Lapras]. He hands [Ash] medicine while he runs to get [Nurse Joy]. [Ash] tries to give [Lapras] the medicine, but [Lapras] knocks it away, [Pikachu] catching it before it breaks. 
At the [[Pokémon] Center], [Nurse Joy] concludes that [Lapras] only needs a rest, but she reveals that it is afraid to have any human contact, probably based on how the three guys were abusing it. The watcher points out that it is only an infant and that it might have gotten separated from its group after the last big storm. He reveals that he is a [Pokémon] watcher and that he observes [Pokémon] in their natural habitats. [Ash] and [Misty] make formal introductions, and the watcher introduces himself as [Tracey]. [Ash] and the others decide to unite in getting that [Lapras] back with its group. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] watch nearby and decide to steal [Lapras]. 
Three kids run in and ask [Nurse Joy] to heal their [Pokémon] in preparation for battling the [Orange Crew]. [Tracey] explains to [Ash] about the [Orange Crew] and how [Trainers] must beat every member of the [Orange Crew] before competing in the [Orange League]. [Ash] wants to compete, but [Misty] reminds him that they need to deliver the [GS Ball] to [Professor [Oak]]. [Ash] places a call to [Professor [Oak]], presenting the [GS Ball] and requesting to compete in the [Orange League]. [Professor [Oak]] approves the decision. Knowing that [Ash] has a connection to [Professor [Oak]], [Tracey] decides to join the group in order to meet the professor.
After [Lapras] wakes up, the group wants to load [Lapras] aboard a truck to take it back to sea, but [Lapras] is afraid to move. [Ash] decides to sing a lullaby, but [Jigglypuff] comes up and beats him to it, putting everyone to sleep with [Sing]. [Jigglypuff] gets angry and goes on its drawing rampage. After everyone wakes up, [Lapras] still won't budge. [Ash] tries to get close to [Lapras], but it retreats underwater. [Ash] takes off his hat and vest before jumping in and swimming after [Lapras]. [Lapras] evades [Ash] long enough, forcing [Ash] to retreat to the surface for air. 
[Team Rocket] fire a bazooka into the pool, creating a white smoke screen as they bind [Lapras] to their own truck. Being a watcher, [Tracey] is amazed at [Meowth]'s talking ability, but [Jessie] and [James] put him down as [James] orders [Weezing] to use [Smog], allowing them to escape in their truck. [Tracey] sends out [Venonat] to use radar eye to track the truck before they can pursue. 
[Team Rocket] have to descend on switchbacks, allowing [Ash] and co. to cut down the hill on bicycles. As they get closer, [Team Rocket] speeds up. [Ash] picks up the pace, getting close enough for him to jump off his bike and directly onto the truck bed. [Ash] moves forward and gets inside the cabin. [Misty] and [Tracey] stop pursuing due to fatigue. [Pikachu] attacks with [Thunderbolt], knocking [James] onto the switch detaching the trailer. [Ash] and [Pikachu] get back onto the truck bed as they head up a ramp. The truck itself flies off the ramp, sending [Team Rocket] blasting off, but the trailer doesn’t follow. As [Ash] loosens the rope binding [Lapras], the trailer begins to roll backwards, quickly picking off speed and almost plunging off a cliff. [Ash] pulls from the side, turning the trailer and avoiding a fall. However, they quickly approach another cliff. [Ash] and [Pikachu] pull, but it fails as the trailer flies off the cliff. With the rope loose, [Lapras] is no longer bound onto the trailer. [Ash] and [Pikachu] grab onto [Lapras] just before all three crash into the sea.
[Misty] and [Tracey] follow [Venonat]'s senses, leading them to the beach. In the distance, [Ash] and [Pikachu] are riding on [Lapras]'s back to the beach. [Lapras] appears comfortable around [Ash] as he proclaims [Lapras] as caught. [Tracey] joins [Ash] and [Misty] as they leave [Tangelo Island], with [Ash]’s intention of earning his first [Orange League] [Badge] and reuniting [Lapras] with its pack.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] are riding [Lapras] across the ocean. They want to stop and find somewhere to eat, and [Tracey] says that they are getting close to [[Mikan] Island], where one of the four [[Gym] Leaders] in the [Orange Crew] is. They talk to [Professor [Oak]] at the [[Pokémon] Center].
[Team Rocket], now in a [Magikarp] submarine, is tracking them, but their submarine gets tangled in seaweed.
On [[Mikan] Island], [Ash], [Misty], [Tracey], [Pikachu], and [Togepi] walk along the path and see [[Mikan] [Gym]] up ahead, but as [Ash] runs toward the [Gym], he spots a coconut on the ground next to a tree. He runs over to it with [Pikachu] and picks it up, but a bucket of water falls on their heads. The coconut was a trap set by a boy named [Senta], but he is told off by [Cissy], his older sister and the [Mikan] [[Gym] Leader].
On the [Orange Islands], the [Gym] battles are different from [Pokémon] battles; First is a [[Water] Gun] challenge, where [[Ash]'s [Squirtle]] and [Cissy]'s [Seadra] shoot [[Water] Guns] at cans on the wall and flying plates. Both are evenly matched and hit every target. To decide the winner, they both aim for the same target, and hit it at the same time.
To break the tie is a [Pokémon] Wave Ride, where [[Ash]'s [Lapras]] and [Cissy]'s [Blastoise] will race to a flag, go around it, and race back to shore. Before the race can begin, however, [Team Rocket] attacks. [James] had to go out and untangle their submarine, and nearly drowned trying to get back to the surface. He says it was similar to a poorly made for TV movie, and [Meowth] hits him with a hammer and tells him to stop being so dramatic. They capture [Blastoise] in a net, and head back underwater, but their submarine stalls and their pedals break. [Blastoise] is too strong for them and gets back to the surface. [Pikachu] dips his tail in the water and uses a [Thunderbolt] to shock them, and [Blastoise] sends them blasting off with [Hydro Pump].
With [Team Rocket] defeated, the [Pokémon] Wave Ride begins. However, [Ash] and [Cissy] must stand on their [Pokémon]'s back. During the race, they are evenly matched; however, [Ash] nearly falls off and is caught by [Lapras], but in the process [Cissy] gets ahead of him and turns around the flag first. Suddenly a tidal wave comes up behind them, and [Lapras] freezes it with [Ice Beam]. The wave sends [Cissy] flying, but she is caught by [Blastoise], and then they get ahead of [Ash]. [Ash] has [Lapras] use [Ice Beam] to make an ice track. [Lapras] is faster on ice than in water, and wins the race.
[Cissy] gives [Ash] a [Coral-Eye [Badge]], and he and his friends ride [Lapras] off the island, continuing their [Pokémon] journey.


Continuing their adventures in the [Orange Islands], [Ash] and his friends have stopped off at [Mandarin Island]. After recalling [Lapras], the trio hear a commotion, and notice a [Grimer], [Voltorb] and four [Magnemite] attacking their [Trainers]. Eager to investigate, [Ash] and the others run to help. However, as [Pikachu] approaches, he stops. When [Ash] inquires as to what is wrong, [Pikachu] just glares at his master. Out of nowhere, [Togepi] jumps out of [Misty]'s arms and glares at its [Trainer] as well. [Pikachu] and [Togepi] then join the other [Pokémon], while [Voltorb] explodes, distracting [Ash] from rescuing his [Pokémon]. When the dust clears, [Officer Jenny] has arrived, but the [Pokémon] are gone.
At police headquarters, Jenny explains that for some time, [Pokémon] have all been disobeying their masters. The only [Pokémon] that doesn't appear to be affected by it is a [Gastly]. Jenny explains that she is hoping by using [Gastly], they will be able to figure out what is going on. [Ash] and the others vow to help as well.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] has arrived on the island. While [Jessie] and [James] want to go exploring, [Meowth] becomes angry with them, saying they have important business to do. Suddenly, [Meowth] pauses. When [Jessie] and [James] ask him what is wrong, he takes off. [Team Rocket] follows [Meowth], and end up in a large room. As they get up, they notice [Butch] and [Cassidy] looking at them. After both sides say their motto, [Butch] and [Cassidy] explain that they are stealing all the [Pokémon] on [Mandarin Island] for [the [Boss]]. They present proof by showing all the [Pokémon] they have stolen so far, which includes [Pikachu], [Togepi] and [Meowth]. Impressed, [Jessie] and [James] decide to steal the [Pokémon] [Butch] and [Cassidy] have taken.
[Jessie] sends out [Arbok] and [Lickitung], while [James] sends out [Weezing] and [Victreebel]. While [Victreebel] bites on his head, [Butch] snaps his fingers. A [Drowzee] hooked up to a machine appears. As [Jessie] and [James] question about it, the [[Psychic]-type] begins using [Hypnosis], causing all four of the Rocket's [Pokémon] to turn against them. [Butch] and [Cassidy] explain that they have [Drowzee] hooked up to an antenna which strengthens and broadcasts it's hypnotic power all across [Mandarin Island], which has allowed them to take control of all the [Pokémon] on the island. Having revealed their plan, they decide to get rid of [Jessie] and [James] and set their own [Pokémon] (including [Meowth]) onto them.
[Jessie] and [James] are later found unconscious and taken to the [[Pokémon] Center]. When they awaken, they are with [Officer Jenny], [Ash] and the others. After explaining that they witnessed [Butch] and [Cassidy] with all the stolen [Pokémon], [Ash] tries to convince them to infiltrate their base again. The duo refuses, until Jenny convinces them that if they do this, they will be thought of as heroes. Liking this idea, [Jessie] and [James] agree to help out.
Looking through a surveillance camera, [Butch] and [Cassidy] see [Jessie] and [James] roll a large cart up to the entrance of their headquarters. It is filled with [[Poké] Balls]. [Jessie] and [James] tell the other Rockets that they would like to make peace, and have brought hundreds of [Pokémon] for them. [Butch] and [Cassidy] are skeptical, but let the duo in anyway. As they enter, [Ash], [Misty] and [Tracey] jump out and demand [Butch] and [Cassidy] return the [Pokémon]. They refuse, saying that with the help of [Drowzee], the [Pokémon] on [Mandarin Island] will do whatever they want them to do. Using [Drowzee], they have all the [Pokémon] attack the [Trainers]. All the electric, fire and water types combine their attacks into a super-powered blast however [Gastly] protects them from it.
Suddenly, [Ash] gets an idea. After [Pikachu] shocks him, he gets up, taunting [Pikachu] into launching another attack. This angers [Pikachu], who tries again. [Ash] keeps dodging the attacks, all while taunting [Pikachu]. Everybody is confused as to what [Ash] is doing. As [Gastly] starts to weaken, [Ash] gets in front of the machine controlling [Drowzee] and taunts [Pikachu] into giving him everything he's got. [Pikachu] launches a massive [ThunderShock], which strikes not only [Ash], but the machine as well. As a result, it overloads and explodes, causing [Drowzee] to lose control of all the [Pokémon].
[Misty] happily runs up to [Togepi], who, upon seeing her, jumps into her arms. [Ash], injured and tired, looks up to see [Pikachu] jump into his arms. The other [Pokémon] are released back onto the island, and run off to find their [Trainers]. However, [Butch] and [Cassidy] refuse to let [Ash] and the others leave. They challenge them to a battle, and [Ash] accepts. Using [Drowzee], [Butch] and [Cassidy] are able to keep [Pikachu] at bay as well as [Jessie] and [James]'s [Pokémon]. They then decide to use the building's antennae to project [Drowzee]'s [Hypnosis] and take control of all the [Pokémon] on the island, but first they need to take care of [Pikachu] and have [Drowzee] use [Metronome]. As the [[Psychic]-type] begins moving its fingers backwards and forwards [Tracey] comments this is trouble, as they don't know what move it will use. At the same time, nobody notices [Togepi] using [Metronome] as well. When it completes the move, an explosion sends [Butch], [Cassidy] and [Drowzee] flying, and their headquarters destroyed.
After the duo is arrested, everyone wonders where the explosion came from. Many attribute it to [Drowzee]'s [Metronome] having backfired on itself. [Ash] and friends then bid [Mandarin Island] farewell and head off on their next adventure.


While riding around the [Orange Islands] on his [Lapras], [Ash] finds a mysterious message in a bottle that says "If you know anything about a [Pokémon] called the [Crystal [Onix]], let me know right away," which leads the gang on a new adventure. [Ash], [Misty] and [Tracey] travel to [Sunburst Island], which is famous for its artists and glassblowers. They meet a struggling young shopkeeper named [Mateo], who’s seeking inspiration from a Legendary [Crystal [Onix]]. Having been unable to find this special [Pokémon], [Ash] and his friends decide to help him in his search. 
[Team Rocket] arrives on [Sunburst Island] as well, and are in awe of the glass shops. [Jessie] and [James] start picking up various pieces and admiring them. [Meowth] yells at them to knock it off, causing [Jessie] and [James] to break the glass items they were holding. The shopkeeper hears this, and tells them about the "You break it, you bought it" rule before he puts them to work, since they don't have the money to pay him back for the items they ruined. While they're chopping and carrying wood, they overhear the shop owner and another employee mock [Mateo] for searching for the [Crystal [Onix]]. [Team Rocket] becomes interested and they leave in search of it. 
[Tracey] sends out [Venonat] to help find the [Crystal [Onix]]. [Mateo] holds up the statue of the [Crystal [Onix]] his grandfather sculpted and [Venonat] scans the image. The group is lead to a series of rocks that are shaped like the body of an [Onix]. Disappointed, [Tracey] recalls [Venonat] and sends out [Marill]. [Tracey] plays [Marill] a recording of [Onix]'s cry and [Marill] quickly detects something. [Marill] leads them to a body of water and points across the water to a small island with a cave. The water begins to part and a clear path to the cave is shown. They fall into a hole [Team Rocket] had dug  to keep them away from the [Crystal [Onix]]. After reciting their motto, [Team Rocket] run off to find the [Crystal [Onix]]. [Ash] and friends climb out of the hole and set off after them. Once they get to the opening of the cave, they discover [Team Rocket] got caught in their own traps. [Misty] refuses to help them and they all enter the cave. At the end of the cave they come across a lake. [Marill] dives in this lake, its tail bobbing above the surface. [Marill] hops out of the water and then the [Crystal [Onix]] bursts out. [Team Rocket] shows up, free from their traps. [Jessie] and [James] send out [Arbok] and [Victreebel] in attempt to catch the [Crystal [Onix]]. [Ash] and [Misty] send out [Pikachu] and [Staryu] to counterattack. [Staryu] and  [Pikachu] attack [Team Rocket], then the [Crystal [Onix]] smacks them in to a blast off.  [Mateo] sends out [Cloyster] to battle [Onix], remarking that [Onix] is weak to [Water] types. [Cloyster]'s water attacks prove to be useless against the [Crystal [Onix]], so [Mateo] sends out [Charmeleon]. [Charmeleon] uses [Ember] and the [Crystal [Onix]] is engulfed in flames. [Mateo] stares at the [Crystal [Onix]], who returns his stares. The [Onix] then faints into the water. [Ash] calls out at [Mateo] to catch it, but [Mateo] says he doesn't need to, he has found inspiration through the [Crystal [Onix]]. The [Crystal [Onix]] dives back into the water. Back at his shop, [Mateo] and [Charmeleon] are busy making a glass figurine. [Ash] and his friends wave goodbye to [Mateo] and Marissa. [Mateo] made [Ash] a lifelike glass sculpture of [Pikachu].


While traveling on [Lapras], [Ash] and his friends are caught in a whirlpool. After they regain consciousness, [Tracey] finds out that they are on [[Pinkan] Island]. They climb the cliffs and see a pink [Rhyhorn]. [Tracey] decides to observe and sketch it, and [Ash], in order to prove to [Misty] that he knows what he's doing, races up to the [Rhyhorn], who promptly knocks him away. [Ash] runs over to [Tracey], and the two boys head for where [Misty] and [Pikachu] are. The team is cornered by the edge of the cliffs, and in order to save them, [Togepi] uses [Metronome] and [Teleports] them away. The [Rhyhorn] goes over the cliff and the team wonders how they escaped. [Officer Jenny] arrives and together they rescue the [Rhyhorn]. Jenny explains that the [[Pinkan] Berries] turn any [Pokémon] that eats them a lot, permanently pink. 
[Team Rocket], having noticed the [Rhyhorn], arrives on the island and see [Jigglypuff]. They think it is special until they realize all [Jigglypuff] are pink.  Before [Jigglypuff] can sing its song, they run off into the forest, planning to catch the pink [Pokémon] and open their own theme park. They use their [Pokémon] to catch the pink ones, and [Lickitung] chases two Pink Nidoran into a cave, and runs straight back out frightened. A [Nidoking] comes out of the cave and chases [Team Rocket] away.
Meanwhile, Jenny is explaining how [[Pinkan] Island] is a reserve and that she won't press charges. The trio contacts [Professor [Oak]], who knew about the island and its pinkness, and he tells them about the research before [Muk] gives him a hug. An alarm sounds and the team offers to help Jenny. [Team Rocket] is still being chased and attempt to defeat [Nidoking], but Jenny and the others appear. They do their motto and [Ash] has [Pikachu] use [ThunderShock], thus shocking [Nidoking]. [Nidoking] throws the Rocket [Pokémon] at their owners and they blast off. [Nidoking] chases the trio and Jenny, and both [Psyduck] and [Marill] attempt to battle him, but ultimately run off scared. 
[Pikachu] tries to shock him, but Jenny informs [Ash] that [Nidoking] is on a rampage and cannot be stopped. [Nidoking] uses [Hyper Beam], but [Togepi] uses [Metronome] again and creates a [Barrier]. Jenny tells the trio to get out and run. She engages [Nidoking] and lassos him, and [Nidoking] drops to the ground dizzy. Jenny drops the team off beyond the whirlpools and [Misty] contemplates [Togepi]'s actions. [Ash] and [Tracey] laugh at her suggestion of [Togepi] attacking. [Ash] notices [Tracey]'s sketch of [Officer Jenny]. [Misty] attempts to get [Togepi] to attack, but is unsuccessful.


Aboard [Lapras], the group follows a news crew to [[Fukuhara] Island No. 4], where a scientific expedition is underway after the discovery of a fossilized [Kabuto]. While on the island [Ash] and the gang are shocked to find out that [Nurse Joy] is the director of the [Kabuto] excursion. While listening to [Nurse Joy] being interviewed by a news reporter they find out that the reason why the crew has come out to the island is to study the habitat of the extinct [Pokémon] [Kabuto]. She also remarks that they would like to find out if the claims about [Kabuto] oil are true or not. The claims being that the oil can not only bring good health, but also cause someone to live forever. After hearing all of this, [Ash] and [Tracey] jump in front of the reporter's camera and ask if they can help with the fossil digging. A moment later, [Ash] looks into the camera and makes a scene, which in turn causes [Misty] to grab him while yelling at him for embarrassing them.
Meanwhile [Team Rocket] have been watching the whole scene from their [Magikarp] submarine, at which [Jessie] says that she wonders why a television crew would be on the island, which then prompts [Meowth] into saying that if they hurry up and catch [Pikachu], they can then maybe catch some face time too.
After the [Team Rocket] scene the show cuts to [Nurse Joy] leading a group of explorers, the news crew, and [Ash]'s group to the digging site. A group of [Growlithe] also accompany the team to possibly find the scent of the [Kabuto]. While [Machoke] are seen carrying some equipment, along with [Rhydon] for drilling holes. As they pass by, a mysterious silhouette of a man is seen behind a tree. They eventually reach a small cliff path which [Misty] is very uneasy about because of the height. At the same time [Team Rocket] is shown following the same path on a lower section of the cliff. As [Nurse Joy]'s team moves on the [Growlithe] start to growl at a large boulder on a hill at which [Nurse Joy] dismisses. Suddenly the boulder gives way and starts racing towards them. As the boulder races down the viewer can see a leg of a man on top of the hill, hinting that the boulder was pushed down by him. While the group is running down the hill, [Ash] mentions to [Nurse Joy] to use the [Machoke]; she agrees and tells them to stop the rock. They succeed and the team is saved. Unfortunately for [Team Rocket], the boulder then rolls off the side of the cliff and hits [James] on the lower level of the cliff into what looks like a canyon.
As the team keeps walking once again,a silhouette of a man is seen, but this time from behind a rock. [Pikachu] catches a glimpse and looks over which catches [Ash]'s attention. After not seeing anything [Ash] says, "Nothing there [Pikachu]." and turns around.  Although, the moment he turns around the man's figure can be seen again. Eventually the team reaches their destination, "a hidden bay on the island's desolate northern shore." Right away the crew gets down to digging with some [Machoke] and [Rhydon] pitching in. As [Ash], [Tracey], [Pikachu], and [Togepi] dig, a bunch of boulders start falling down from the top of the cliffs onto them. Luckily [Nurse Joy] commands [Rhydon] to use [Horn Drill] on the crashing boulders and once again the team is saved.
After the second near boulder catastrophe [Misty] mentions that she thinks all these accidents aren't really accidents — that maybe someone else is causing all these bad things to happen. [Tracey] brings up the point that the island is supposed to be deserted and that can't possibly be true. Just as he says that a dark silhouette of a man is seen running from behind a tree at which [Pikachu] notices and starts chasing after him. [Ash] follows suit and ends up jumping on the man, bringing them both to the ground. As the rest of the crew catches up, the identity of the man is finally revealed. With that, he then sternly tells them all to leave the island while admitting that he has been the one who has been pushing the boulders onto them.
The man then explains that he was only trying to keep them out of danger. He then tells of an ancient prophecy which implies that anyone who comes to the island to disturb the [Kabuto] will cause the island to be swallowed by the sea. At that moment, an explorer comes running into the forest, ecstatic to have found another [Kabuto] fossil. This then causes the team and the man to venture into a cave where the fossil was found. When they get to the end of the cave they find tons of [Kabuto] fossils on the walls. Suddenly the cave starts to crumble only to reveal [Team Rocket], who plan to steal all the [Kabuto] fossils for themselves. [James] then throws a bomb that gets passed around until [Ash] catches it and throws it at the wall of [Kabuto] [Fossils]. The fossils then explode off the wall, and [Team Rocket] wraps them up in a net and tries to get away with their hot air balloon. The [Kabuto] then end up coming to life as the light of the moon hits them and one ends up popping [Team Rocket]'s balloon which leads to them blasting away.
As the island starts to crumble apart the team decides to head for the boat, but the strange man insists that the prophecy said to run into the forest and make a raft. So they listen to the man and start building a makeshift raft. As the island sinks they all jump on the raft, and [Ash] sends out his [Lapras] and [Squirtle], while [Misty] sends out her [Staryu] and [Goldeen] to help pull the raft. They all make it to sea safely and watch the island completely sink. Joy remarks that maybe the [Kabuto] oil does cause them to live forever. She then apologizes to the man for not believing him, and the news reporter says that she thinks it's best that no one ever find out the [Kabuto]'s secret. At the end, the [Kabuto] are seen swimming towards the moonlight, looking for a new safe home.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] continue exploring the [Orange Archipelago] when they stumble upon a floating theater where all the actors, singers, and dancers are [Pokémon]. The three of them decide they would like to see the show and enter the boat. All the [Pokémon] in the show can talk which consists of a [Hitmonchan] fighting a [Machoke] in a boxing ring for a [Clefable], with an [Abra] as the referee. As the show comes to an end, [Ash] says that he guesses there are more [Pokémon] than just [Meowth] who can talk. At the same time [Togepi] ends up wandering off and walks behind the stage. [Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] see this and run after [Togepi]. When they finally catch up to [Togepi], they find out that the [Pokémon] in the performance weren't really talking. They were only moving their mouths as three people behind a glass wall voiced them. As they watch from behind a young actress named [Kay] appears and yells at them to be quiet. As the performance ends with the [Pokémon] dancing on stage, a man comes out and asks [Kay] to have her [Raichu] come out to the stage and dance with the other [Pokémon]. [Raichu] then appears from out behind a box and when [Kay] asks [Raichu] to perform it just sits there sadly and refuses. 
The voice actors of the show and [Ash]'s crew are then seen sailing on the floating theater to the next island. [Ash] thanks one of the voice actors named [Roger] for taking them along and asks if there is anything they could do for him in return for the ride. He then says that he would like [Ash] to teach  [Kay] some pointers on how to become closer with her [Raichu]. As the boat keeps on sailing, [Team Rocket] is seen in their [[Magikarp] [Submarine]] plotting on how to steal the performing [Pokémon].
Back on the floating theater [Ash] is trying to teach [Kay] how to get along with her [Pokémon]. [Ash] asks [Kay] to show him a performance with her and [Raichu], which she does, but [Raichu] continues to do nothing. [Ash] then tries to give [Raichu] some words of encouragement, but ends up getting shocked in the process.
Later on [Kay] is standing on the deck of the boat looking at the water when [Ash] tries to talk to her about [Raichu]. [Kay] then explains that the reason why [Raichu] won't perform is her fault. She tells the story of how [Raichu] shocked her, out of happiness and excitement, when they first met, which caused [Kay] to throw [Raichu] off her. Because of that day, [Raichu] is now too nervous to perform with [Kay] anymore because it can sense [Kay]'s fears of being shocked again. Just then [Team Rocket] fires two torpedoes at the boat which sends [Raichu] flying into [Kay]'s arms. [Raichu] starts to shock [Kay] and [Kay] reassures [Raichu] that it's okay and that she isn't afraid of being shocked anymore.
[Team Rocket] then appears aboard the boat. [Ash] tries to stop them, but [Roger] insists to do what they say because they don't want the boat to be destroyed since it is their livelihood. Everyone on the boat is then seen tied up on the lower deck by [Team Rocket]. [Team Rocket] then leaves them to go and steal the performing [Pokémon]. [Meowth] told the performing [Pokémon] that he is their boss; he notices [Raichu] crying and threatens it not to do so, only to get shocked instead. [Hitmonchan] shows a frightening face towards [Meowth] and [James], who express their wishes to get along. Upon noticing [Roger]'s eye movements, [Hitmonchan] pretended to agree with [James], but suddenly punches him back. 
The voice actors end up getting up with the ropes still around them and cause a distraction by voicing over the [Pokémon] [Team Rocket] is trying to steal, which they fall for as the [Pokémon] really being able to talk. [Hitmonchan] uses [[Fire] Punch] and burns [James]' face, which angers [James] further and he sends out [Victreebel], only for him to get devoured by it. [Jessie] takes over the command, sends out [Weezing] and orders it to use [Smokescreen];  which chokes everyone on the ship, except for [Ash] and friends who break free from the ropes. [James] calls back [Weezing] and the smoke disperses; [Ash] and [Tracey] appears to stop [Team Rocket] with [Pikachu] and [Marill]. [Kay] then teams up with her [Raichu] and uses [Mega Punch] to blast [Team Rocket] off the boat.
As the boat stops at another island and prepares for the next show [Ash] is seen talking to [Oak] on the telephone about the floating theater. Just then [Kay] runs out of the boat and tells [Ash] that [Roger] can't perform in the show because he's lost his voice from [Team Rocket]'s [SmokeScreen] earlier. [Kay] volunteers to fill in for [Roger] in the performance. [Ash] and his [Pikachu] then end up volunteering to help out in the show while [Tracey]'s and [Misty]'s [Pokémon] can both also be seen performing in the show, as well.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] have stopped on an island ([[Kinnow] Island]) to rest. They've sent a few of their [Pokémon] out to stretch, and a few ride [Lapras] around. One of these is [[Misty]'s [Psyduck]] who (asleep) falls off. [Lapras] swims back to shore, and [Pikachu] and [Togepi] tell [Ash] and his friends that the duck [Pokémon] is missing. [Misty] is horrified and they send out the rest of their [[Water]-type] [Pokémon] to help look for it. Nearby, a girl is fishing while her [Tentacruel] swims about. [Psyduck] surfaces, flailing about in the water.
The [Pokémon] return, having had no luck finding [Psyduck]. [Misty] is still upset, and [Ash] notes how unusual this is. [Tracey] says that he believes [Psyduck] is [Misty]'s favorite [Pokémon] and that she just hides her feelings. The girl with the [Tentacruel] rows over and asks them if the [Psyduck] she found is theirs. It is, but [Psyduck]'s tail is glowing a bright pink.
[Misty] thanks the girl, who introduces herself as [Marina]. She points at [Psyduck]'s glowing tail, and says that a [Trainer] once told her that when this happens, the [Psyduck] is about to evolve. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] and it tells him that [Golduck], [Psyduck]'s evolved form, is the fastest of all water [Pokémon]. Both [Misty] and [Marina] say that [Golduck] is one of their favorite [Pokémon]. They talk about water [Pokémon] for a moment, completely shutting out [Ash] and [Tracey]. After showing each other some lures they made and wishing they could catch one of the legendary [Pokémon] of the sea, [Marina] asks [Misty] why [Psyduck] can't swim. [Misty] covers for it, saying that it's a rare breed. [Marina] then suggests that they battle each other to see which is the most powerful water [[Pokémon] [Trainer]], to which [Misty] agrees.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] peers at the shore through the periscope of the [Magikarp] submarine. [Meowth] yells at [Jessie] for losing [Ash] and his friends, only to be whacked by her long hair. [James] asks to find a place for lunch, and [Jessie] tells them all to stop whining. She looks through the periscope once more and notices [Misty] and [Marina] getting ready to battle. They sit and watch, waiting for the right moment to strike.
As [Team Rocket] watches, the battle between [Misty] and [Marina] begins. They agree to a three-on-three battle, and send out their first [Pokémon]. [Marina] uses [Tentacruel] and [Misty] sends out her [Goldeen]. Using [Agility], [Goldeen] dodges [Tentacruel]'s [Wrap], and lunges for a [Horn Attack]. Unfortunately, [Tentacruel] stabs it with a [Poison Sting]. [Goldeen] floats to the surface, defeated. [Marina] tells [Misty] that she likes water [Pokémon] that have another type as well, as this gives her a slight advantage. [Misty] sends out [Staryu], and [Marina] compliments her on how good it looks. It is as powerful as it is good-looking, and it defeats [Tentacruel] with a single [Swift] attack.
[Marina] sends out a [Psyduck] of her own, who looks a lot stronger than [Misty]'s. [Staryu] uses [[Water] Gun], but [Psyduck] deflects it with [Confusion] and it hits [Staryu], defeating it. [Marina] suggests that [Misty] send out her [Psyduck], and [Tracey] tells [Misty] a battle might be enough to make [Psyduck] evolve. [Misty] tosses out a [[Poké] Ball] to use her [Psyduck], but it falls into the water empty. Embarrassed, [Misty] tells [Ash] to get [Psyduck]'s [[Poké] Ball] for her, but he can't tell which one it is. He tosses her backpack to her, but it falls short. She reaches into the water to get it, and when she pulls it up, a [Pokémon]'s head is stuck in it. She yanks it off, and everyone is amazed: it's a [Golduck]. Apparently, [Psyduck] evolved.
[Misty] runs over and hugs it. She says that nobody will yell at it like they did to [Psyduck]. [Ash] comments to [Tracey] that the person who yelled at it the most was [Misty] herself. He thinks that [Psyduck] evolved because it loves her. The battle continues, with [Misty] using [Golduck]. [Psyduck] uses [Confusion], and a wave races at [Misty]. [Golduck] leaps onto the wave and, using its [Psychic] powers, deflects it back to [Marina]. Just as it is about to hit, the wave twists into an inverted whirlpool. [Golduck] jumps off just in time to avoid the [Magikarp] submarine, which pops out of the water.
Everybody hurries away, and [Pikachu]'s attempts to shock the submarine fail. A wave from the sub sweeps over them, and a net is fired. [Team Rocket] climbs out and discovers that they didn't capture [Golduck] and [Pikachu] as they had hoped, but have netted [Marina]'s [Tentacruel] and [Psyduck]. [Ash] and his friends cling to the tree that the wave swept them onto, and [Marina] realizes that her [Pokémon] are missing. The kids jump down and [Marina] sends out a [Starmie] who swims over to the sub. [Golduck] jumps in, too, and quickly overtakes [Marina]'s [Pokémon].
[Team Rocket] argues amongst themselves about whose idea it was to attack, and [Golduck] jumps out of the water. [Team Rocket] moves to attack it, but they are thrown onto the beach by [Golduck]'s [Psychic] abilities. [Team Rocket] crawls out of the sub and recites their motto. [Ash] tells them to give [Marina] back her [Pokémon] and [Jessie] and [James] seem all too happy to oblige. However, [Meowth] jumps up and insists that [Ash] has to hand over [Pikachu] before [Marina] gets her [Pokémon] back.
[Marina] tells her [Pokémon] to wiggle out of the net, but they are too tired. [Marina] runs at [Jessie], but [Jessie] stops her with her [Arbok]. It lunges at her, but is slammed into a tree by a stream of water. Everyone looks over and sees [Golduck] walking up from the water. It blocks [Arbok]'s [Poison Sting] with a [Disable], then slams it into the air with a [Psychic]. [Team Rocket] runs back into their sub, but [Golduck] destroys it with a [Hyper Beam]. [Team Rocket] is thrown into the air and blast off once again. As the sub burns, [Marina] yells out for [Tentacruel] and [Psyduck]. [Golduck] walks out, carrying both above its head and protecting them with another [Barrier]. [Marina] thanks it and [Misty] hugs it.
Moments later, [Misty] and [Marina] are back at the rocks from before, continuing their battle. [Marina] uses [Starmie], who uses [Tackle] against [Golduck]. It then attacks with [Bubble]. [Golduck] sends out a [Hyper Beam], and [Starmie] creates a [Light Screen] to block it. It almost works, but the screen shatters and the beam connects with its target. [Misty] wins and she cheers for her [Golduck]. [Misty] then holds out a [[Poké] Ball] and tells [Golduck] to take a rest, but [Psyduck] pops out of it. Everyone is stunned. As [Misty] tries to sort out the situation, [Golduck] notices three girls walking along the beach. It runs over and starts flexing its muscles for the girls, who are impressed. [Marina] realizes that it wasn't [Misty]'s [Golduck] at all, it was just a [Golduck] that liked to show off in front of girls. [Misty] then says "It's just a [Pokémon] version of [Brock]," visibly shattered.
Later, [Ash] asks where [Psyduck] was all this time. Apparently it was resting in its [[Poké] Ball]. [Misty] asks if it is going to evolve into [Golduck] anyway, but its tail isn't glowing anymore. [Marina] congratulates her, however, saying that she was able to control a wild, evolved [Pokémon] without catching it. [Misty] cheers up until [Ash] says that since [Golduck] wasn't hers, the battle with it didn't count.
That evening, they all say farewell to [Marina]. [Misty] tells her that she wants a rematch once [Psyduck] finally does evolve and [Lapras] rides off into the sunset.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] are riding on [Lapras] through the waters of the [Orange Islands]. Everyone is keeping busy; [Ash] is polishing the [GS Ball], [Tracey] is [Pokémon] watching, and [Misty] is playing with [Togepi]. All of a sudden, splashes of water in the distance become ever closer to the group. As the waves rush past, we see a kayak being propelled by a very tan [Nurse Joy] and her [Chansey]. [Tracey] recognizes the nurse, and [Ash], unsure of what it was, orders [Lapras] to follow the boat and catch up to whatever had sped past.
They arrive at a small island, where they find a deserted kayak on the beach and two pairs of footprints in the sand. [Tracey] describes the prints as belonging to a [Chansey] and a woman with a size-7 sneaker. After following the footprints to a small bay, they realize there are no more tracks to follow. [Misty] states her uncertainty that what had passed them on a boat was a [Nurse Joy]. [Tracey] recalls the moment, saying that the woman seemed more muscular than an average Joy. Just then, a giant [Magikarp] jumped up out of the bay and began flopping around on the rock at the group's feet. [Misty], worried that the [Water] [Pokémon] will run out of air, proposes that they help it get back into the water; [Ash] agrees. Before they can figure out how to help the [Pokémon], [Nurse Joy] and [Chansey] appears to help [Magikarp]. Joy gives [Magikarp] a bottle of [Calcium] tablets and throws it back into the water. [Nurse Joy] tells [Ash] and his friends that she travels from island to island helping sick and injured [Pokémon], because a lot of the Orange islands are too small for [[Pokémon] Centers]. She invites the group to her local clinic for lunch.
Back at her clinic, [Nurse Joy] demonstrates her abilities by treating [[Ash]'s [Lapras]]. Eager to see [Nurse Joy] in action, [Ash] and his friends ask if they can help with her work. [Ash], [Misty], [Tracey], and [Nurse Joy] all set off in kayaks. We see the group in a variety of situations where [Nurse Joy]'s assistance is needed. Many [Trainers]' [Pokémon] are helped: a [Kingler], an [Onix], and a [Mankey], among others. 
A little while later, the group falls behind in their kayaks, and loses sight of [Nurse Joy]. When they finally catch up to her kayak, it is empty; both [Chansey] and Joy are missing. [Tracey] believes that a [Gyarados] could have tipped her boat over. Suddenly, they see a pink figure appear from the water, thinking it might be [Chansey]; the figure turns over and reveals itself to be [Jigglypuff]. Before the [Pokémon] can begin to sing, they race away in their kayaks. When they finally stop, they see [Nurse Joy] and [Chansey], with its first-aid kit, pop up out of the water. She states that she went underwater to treat a sick [Cloyster], and sends [Chansey] to retrieve their kayak. [Ash] and [Tracey] become curious as to how Joy can treat [Pokémon] underwater, so she offers to show them. The boys in their swimming attire jump into the water and follow the nurse to the ocean floor. There, we see a sick [Shellder] that [Nurse Joy] begins to examine. Unable to hold his breathe any longer, [Ash] begins to struggle. Just then, a wild [Dewgong] grabs onto him with its fins. The [Pokémon] seems to be playing with [Ash]. [Nurse Joy] rescues him from [Dewgong] and they all head back to shore.
At the clinic, [Ash] is warming up under a blanket with a hot beverage. The group collectively states that [Nurse Joy]'s job is not easy, and that it would be easier to just run a [[Pokémon] Center] like all of the other Joys. She begins to tell a story from her childhood. She says when she was a little girl, she found a tiny injured [Magikarp] on the beach. She decided to take it home and nurse it back to health. When the [Pokémon] was healthy once again, she released it back into the ocean. A little while after that, while on a boat with her family, she fell into the water; she was then promptly saved by [Magikarp], the same [Magikarp] that she had helped on its way to full health, who had grown considerably. Joy says that moment was when she decided to dedicate her life to [Pokémon], especially those without [Trainers] to care for them. [Misty] asks her whether the [Magikarp] they had seen earlier that day was the same [Magikarp] she had helped. [Nurse Joy] says that it was, and that her and the [Water] [Pokémon] have been friends ever since that day.
Outside, the group sees the warning signs of an upcoming storm. [Nurse Joy] explains to them that she has one more stop for the day; [Ash] apologizes for throwing her off schedule. She says that when dealing with [Pokémon], one should always expect the unexpected. [Tracey] expresses his worry over the surely upcoming hurricane, and states that it is too dangerous for Joy to go out on the water again. She says that there is a group of sick baby [Seel] waiting for her help. Despite [Tracey]'s begging for her to wait until the storm passes, [Nurse Joy] leaves on her kayak with [Chansey] anyway. Worried for her safety, the group follows the nurse in kayaks without her knowing.
Out in the middle of the ocean, the choppy waves are making it difficult for everyone to control their boats. [Ash] shouts for [Nurse Joy] from behind, and she looks back in surprise. Just then, a huge wave sends [Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] flying into the air and out of their kayaks. [Nurse Joy] yells to them to send out their [Water] [Pokémon] to help keep them afloat; [Ash] sends out [Squirtle], [Tracey] sends out [Marill], and [Misty] her [Staryu] (along with [Psyduck], who is unable to swim). The nurse tells them to follow her to a nearby island. 
On the very small island's beach, the sun is shining once again. With everyone safe from the ocean's wrath, [Tracey] apologizes to [Nurse Joy] for intervening in her efforts to help the baby [Seel]. Joy says that it was alright, and that they were just trying to help. Before continuing on their way to help the group of [Seel], they decide to take a short rest. Suddenly, we see [Team Rocket] spying on the group from their [[Magikarp] [Submarine]]. Intent on capturing [Pikachu], as well as [Chansey], [Meowth] seems very confident that they will succeed this time. He tells [James] that there is no way they can "lose" with his new secret weapon. [Meowth] then hits a button, which sends a torpedo-like object flying from the submarine, up and out of the water. The object releases a net that entraps [Ash], [Misty], [Tracey], [Nurse Joy], [Pikachu], and [Chansey] on the beach. Appearing from the water in the mechanical [Magikarp], [Team Rocket] recites their motto. [Nurse Joy] is intent on escaping, so she can help the baby [Seel]. Just as tears begin to form in her eyes, an ominous figure rams into [Team Rocket]'s submarine from below the water. The giant [Magikarp] befriended by [Nurse Joy] jumps up out of the water with menacing glare. With numerous [Tackle] attacks, [Magikarp] tries to rid the ocean of the trio of thieves. As Joy calls out to the [Pokémon] for help, it begins to evolve. Using its newly formed tail, [Gyarados] whips [Team Rocket] off into the distance. [Gyarados] turns around to look at the group stuck in the net, and they begin to worry that its evolution caused a change in its demeanor. The [Pokémon] lunges towards shore, but, instead of attacking, [Gyarados] gets close to [Nurse Joy] so she can pet it. [Gyarados] removes the net with its mouth and flings it into the ocean. [Misty] exclaims that the [Pokémon] evolved into [Gyarados], but kept [Magikarp]'s personality. Joy thanks her friend for its help. [Nurse Joy] is finally able to reach the island that is home to the group of sick baby [Seel], and treat them.
[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] admire the relationship between [Nurse Joy] and [Gyarados]. [Tracey] sketches the two of them together and says that if everyone would treat their [Pokémon], and each other, with the care, love and respect they deserve, the world would be picture-perfect. Joy then remembers [Ash] telling her of his plans to become a [[Pokémon] Master]; she tells him of [Navel Island]. She says [Navel Island] is home to an [Orange League] [Gym], and that he might be able to win a [Badge] there. The group head on their way atop [Lapras].


[Ash] and his friends spot [Navel Island], the home of the second [Orange League] [Gym] and the [Sea [Ruby] [Badge]]. They touch down on the beach near a very quiet village, but the [Gym] is nowhere to be found. A man approaches on a sailboat, introducing himself as [Danny] and immediately appealing to [Misty], shocking [Ash] and [Tracey]. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] spots them from their [[Magikarp] [Submarine]]. [Misty] notes [Danny]'s large backpack and contrasts it to [Ash]'s lack of preparation, which begins an argument. [Danny] notes that they are close, but [Misty] calls [Ash] a little kid, which irritates [Ash]. [Tracey] thinks [Danny] is another [Trainer] seeking the [[Gym] [Badge]].
They approach the [Navel [Gym]] gate, and [Ash] opens it. Inside, there is a cable car and a trail leading up the mountain. [Pikachu] points at a sign that gives instructions. It declares that challengers must climb up the mountain without using [Pokémon] or risk disqualification, while spectators can use the cable car. [Danny] also climbs along, moving at a seemingly easy pace while [Ash] is struggling with both the exertion and a slight fear of heights. At one point, [Misty] and [Tracey] pass via the cable car, and [Misty] calls to [Danny]. This irritates and distracts [Ash], which causes him to slip and fall down. He grabs a ledge and attempts to call out [Bulbasaur], but [Danny] reminds him of the rule. [Ash] puts the [[Poké] Ball] back and manages to climb back up. 
[Ash] takes a rest, exhausted, while [Pikachu] and [Danny] enjoy the mountain air. [Ash] thanks [Danny] for the warning. Suddenly, [Team Rocket] grabs [Pikachu] with a suction cup and attempts to pull him to their balloon. [Ash] grabs [Pikachu] and [Danny] removes the suction cup, cutting off [Team Rocket]’s motto. They launch another plug, but [Danny] attaches it to a rock, which flies back and ruptures the balloon, sending it flying into the clouds. The balloon runs into a water geyser, which sends the balloon flying even higher. 
[Ash] and [Danny] continue hiking up, the weather turning to snow. [Ash] shivers while [Danny] seems unaffected. [Pikachu] collapses from the cold and [Ash] runs to [Pikachu], taking off his vest and wrapping [Pikachu] and holding him closer. [Danny] watches with admiration as [Ash] and [Pikachu] press forward. At the summit, [Misty] and [Tracey] are waiting, wrapped in blankets. [Ash] and [Danny] arrive, and they run to meet. [Misty] runs past [Ash] to [Danny], offering to share her blanket. [Danny] reveals to everyone that he is the [[Gym] Leader] since nobody was at the top when [Misty] and [Tracey] arrived. 
[Danny] announces that the match is composed of three rounds, and two of three wins. The first test is to freeze a hot water geyser. [Danny] uses [Nidoqueen] while [Ash] summons [Lapras]. Both [Pokémon] fire [Ice Beam] attacks at the geysers. While [Lapras] makes steady progress, [Nidoqueen] is much faster and freezes the geyser first, winning the round. [Lapras] manages to complete the task but winds up exhausted.
The second round is to carve the ice into a sled with three [Pokémon]. [Ash] sends out [Pikachu], [Bulbasaur] and surprisingly [Charizard]. [Misty] and [Tracey] know that [Charizard] won't obey. [Danny] uses [Machoke], [Scyther] and [Nidoqueen]. [Danny]’s team uses brute force to make adequate progress while [Charizard] loafs around. [Bulbasaur]’s [Vine Whip] and [Pikachu]’s [Thunderbolt] are not as effective, putting them behind while [Ash] tries to get [Charizard] to work. [Charizard] uses [Flamethrower] on [Ash] before using four more to perfectly carve the sled and win the round. 
The final round is to race down the mountain to the beach goal line. [Danny] puts [Geodude], [Electrode] and [Scyther] into his sled while [Ash] rides with [Pikachu], [Bulbasaur] and [Squirtle]. When the light turns green, both teams race down as fast as possible while [Misty] and [Tracey] use the cable car. [Danny]’s [Scyther] steers his sled while [Ash] uses [Bulbasaur]'s vines to steer, although [Ash] spins out of control. [Danny] watches and speeds ahead expertly, but runs into [Team Rocket]'s pit trap. [Ash] notices and stops the sled to help. [Danny] knows it's a trap as [Team Rocket] reveals themselves. [Meowth] activates another switch as both teams fall into a larger pit trap. [Team Rocket] takes [Pikachu] and tries to escape. [Bulbasaur] uses its vines to get [Ash] and [Danny] out, and the [Pokémon] create snowballs, with [Geodude] launching them. [Scyther] loads [Electrode] onto a plank as everyone else propels it to the balloon. [Pikachu] gets clear of the balloon as [Danny] orders [Electrode] to use [Explosion] to destroy the balloon and send [Team Rocket] blasting off again. 
They restart the race and launch when the sun comes out from behind a cloud. Both teams race down, as [Misty] and [Tracey] wait. The terrain changes from snow to rock. [Ash]’s sled picks up too much speed and barely misses a large rock, causing the craft to cut through trees. [Danny] closes in on the finish line, but [Ash] soars through the sky and catches up with [Danny]. The landing causes [Ash]’s sled to shrink in size, and the lighter sled allows [Ash] to pull forward and win the race, crashing into the ocean. [Danny] congratulates [Ash] and hands him the [Sea [Ruby] [Badge]]. [Ash] accepts it with excitement. [Misty] and [Tracey] are glad that [Ash] won, but [Misty] is also partially upset that [Danny] lost. [Ash] and co. get back on [Lapras] and leave [Navel Island].


[Ash] and his friends arrive at the [Seven Grapefruit Islands], known for its large grapefruit harvest. However, just as they pick a grapefruit for themselves, they are stopped by a girl named [Ruby], who mistakes them for thieves. After clearing the confusion, [Ruby] explains how they tend to the grapefruit trees to produce their high-quality grapefruits. However, [Ruby] also notes that they had been recently had a problem with thieves making off with the grapefruits. When the thieves strike again, [Ash] and company go and help [Ruby].
It turns out that it was not thieves stealing the grapefruit, but instead a [Snorlax] that has been eating them. Devising a plan to stop [Snorlax], [Ash] and company assist with [Ruby]'s staff to harvest as many grapefruits as possible - [Bulbasaur] and [Staryu] assisting as well. However, all it does is lead [Snorlax] to their cache, and when [Ash] tries to fend off the [Snorlax], [Bulbasaur] ends up flattened by [Snorlax]'s [Body [Slam]].
Later, [Snorlax] has already eaten the first island dry. Thinking that they will be safe now that [Snorlax] has nowhere to go, they are surprised to find that [Snorlax] can swim, explaining how it could arrive on the island. While [Ruby] and her crew try to pick the grapefruits as quickly as possible, [Ash] and company try to stop [Snorlax]. On the second island, [Team Rocket] is also picking grapefruits - to steal. While [Meowth] notes at the hardness of the grapefruits ([James] opining that these are grapefruits which are grown not for the fruit but for candied peels), they manage to get the fruits that they need. However, before they can make their getaway, [Snorlax], with [Ash] and company, races towards them. [Snorlax] begins to eat [Team Rocket]'s loot, which forces [Team Rocket] to try to stop [Snorlax].
However, the combined forces of [Team Rocket] and the heroes are no match for [Snorlax]: [Squirtle], [Arbok], and [Victreebel] are flattened, [Lickitung]'s [Wrap] is caught by [Snorlax] (who uses the tongue to wipe itself), while [Goldeen] is flailing about on land and [Psyduck] is caught choking on a grapefruit, while [Staryu]'s and [Pikachu]'s attacks are rendered ineffective. Thinking of alternative plans to stop [Snorlax], they agree on trying to put it asleep. A massage by [Ash]'s crew does not seem to make it fall asleep, while [James]' hypnotist routine and [Misty]'s [Snorlax]-counting both make their users fall asleep before [Snorlax]. [Jessie]'s idea of using a [Snorlax] suit and pretending to act as [Snorlax]'s mother gets [Team Rocket] sent flying into the air from a [Mega Kick]. Now left alone, [Ash] and company come up with a plan to have [Jigglypuff] sing to it. But in order to do so, they will first have to find [Jigglypuff], and then, before anyone can fall asleep, catch it in a [[Poké] Ball].
As if by chance, [Ash] and company arrive to where [Ruby] is located just in time to see her staff asleep, with marking scattered about the faces of the workers. Surmising that [Jigglypuff] is nearby, [Ash] and company decide to build a stage for [Jigglypuff], complete with colored markers and large signage. Just as [Snorlax] strips the second island and is heading towards them on the third, [Jigglypuff] shows up and begins to sing, while [Ash] and [Pikachu] manage to hold off sleeping long enough to land a [Thunder] on [Snorlax] and catch it in a [[Poké] Ball]. Once again, [Jigglypuff] uses its marker (and the new colored markers) to mark everyone for falling asleep.
Later, as [Ash] and company leave the island, [Ruby] arrives to tell them that the islands stripped bare by [Snorlax] have since had new saplings regrow. [Ruby] thanks their help for containing [Snorlax] by giving [Ash] and company a bag of candied grapefruit peels.


[Ash] is admiring his two [Orange Crew] [Badges] and [Tracey] tells him he needs two more to enter the [Orange League]. [Ash] wonders whether it would be easy to earn them. They come across [Moro Island] and long for a nice meal at the [[Pokémon] Center]. After supper, they call [Professor [Oak]], who tells them a 300 year-old official [Orange League] [Winner's Trophy] has been found. They decide to go to the museum the following day just to take a look. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] breaks into the museum and steals the trophy. During the escape, [James] accidentally falls and leaves his shape holding the trophy on the ground.
When [Ash] and his friends get to the museum, a crowd is waiting outside. [Officer Jenny] is keeping the door and tells them the trophy has been stolen. A pair of footprints and the shape in the mud of the unknown thief holding the trophy are the only clues. [Ash], [Misty] and [Tracey] decide to investigate. Not far from there, they find [Team Rocket] behind some bushes, mentioning their mischief during the previous night. [Ash] and friends begin chasing them, but [Team Rocket] escapes using a [Seadra]-shaped boat. The heroes get on [Lapras] and continue the chase.
Suddenly, a thick fog catches [Team Rocket], who eventually find an abandoned ship in the middle of the fog. They decide to use it as a hideaway, but a ghost appears just behind them. Scared, they try to run away, but the ship is in a poor condition and they fall through the floor to a lower level. Now two ghosts begin harassing them and take the trophy from [James]'s bag. After that, the two ghosts attack [Team Rocket] and haul them off.
[Ash] and friends find the ship and notice the [Seadra]-shaped boat is empty just next to it, a sign that [Team Rocket] is surely hiding in the ship. As they get on, [Misty] starts shivering and [Togepi] falls into a hole in the floor. The gang starts looking for [Togepi] all around the ship, when they finally find it, playing with the two ghosts in one of the cabins. The [Orange League] trophy is laying on a bedside table. [Ash] sends out [Bulbasaur], but it stops its attack because it seemed the ghosts were playing with [Togepi], not frightening it. So [Misty] calls for [Staryu], who uncovers the true identity of the ghosts behind the sheets: [Gastly] and [Haunter]. [Ash] and friends say they want the trophy for the museum, but [Gastly] and [Haunter] refuse to hand it over.
[Team Rocket] gets to the cabin and starts fighting the ghosts to get the trophy back, but they are unsuccessful and faint. [Haunter] takes control of [Meowth] and makes it relay the history of the two ghosts. Meanwhile, [Gastly] creates an illusion to show with images what [Haunter] was talking about. Three centuries before, the [Gastly] and [Haunter]'s [Trainer] was the captain of the ship. He was a well-known [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] and managed to win the [Orange League]. The ancient trophy on the bedside table belonged to him. But a sea storm put an end to his life and the ship sank. [Gastly] and [Haunter] had watched over their master's trophy for three centuries until some weeks before, a group of researchers found the sunken ship and took the trophy away. They drove the ship to surface again to recover it, and now they had it back, they would leave with it.
When [Haunter] finishes talking, [Meowth] wakes up [Jessie] and [James] and they try to fight the ghosts again. Once more, they are blasted off. [Ash] and friends understand the [Pokémon]'s loyalty to their master even 300 years after and respect their decision. [Ash] says whether the captain was or not around there is not an excuse to take what belongs to him from where it belongs. They finally say goodbye to [Gastly] and [Haunter], who take the ship to the sky and take it to a place where it could not be found.


[Team Rocket]'s [[Magikarp] [Submarine]] has washed up on rocks while [Jessie] and [James] initiate repairs. [James] wants [Meowth] to use [Pay Day] so they can have money, but [Meowth] can't learn it because his ability to talk negates his ability to learn it. He turns the argument around when he thinks [James] is hiding coins, and [Jessie] searches him, finding his favorite gold bottle cap. When [Team Rocket] spots [Ash] and his friends in the distance, looking for an island to rest at, they decide to confront them. Before they can do anything, the submarine begins to sink. [Ash] sends [Squirtle] to attack with [[Water] Gun], sending [Jessie] and [James] blasting off. [Meowth] follows soon after, but flies much farther than [Jessie] and [James]. 
On another island ([Golden Island]), people gather around a gold [Meowth] statue, wishing for the Great [Meowth] of Bounty to arrive as predicted, on the night of the full moon. Meanwhile, [Meowth] crashes on the beach of that island. The island people find [Meowth] and take him inland, putting him in front of the statue. The villagers honor [Meowth] with a fruit offering. [Meowth]'s talking shocks the villagers, but they still accept him as the [Meowth] of Bounty. Everyone hails [Meowth] as such and he decides to take advantage of it, snacking on all the fruit. 
By the next day, [Meowth] begins to enjoy the humble treatment, ordering the villagers to bring him meatballs and entertainment. As [Meowth] watches over the coast and plays a guitar, he wishes that [Jessie] and [James] were with him. He notices [Ash] and his friends approaching and knows that they will blow his cover. Knowing this threatens his happiness, he orders the villagers to force them off the island, propagating them as hostile. The villagers use the [Meowth] statue to confront [Ash], attacking with its giant paw. They dodge and [Ash] attacks with [Pikachu]'s [Thunderbolt], but it does nothing. The machine chases them off the island and forces them to jump back into the sea. The [Meowth] statue returns to the ark with [Jessie] and [James] in tow. [Meowth] decides to lie by saying he doesn’t know them, for fear they will ruin his happiness as well. The villagers order them to be thrown back into the sea. [Meowth] looks away as the statue hauls them off.
[Team Rocket] manages to sneak back onto the island and watch [Meowth] enjoying himself. The villagers decide to begin the ceremony that [Meowth] will use [Pay Day] to bring them happiness and prosperity, as the prophecy foretells. Knowing that his inability to use the move will blow his cover, [Meowth] tries to leave, but the statue grabs [Meowth] and shakes him continually for coins. It fails as [Meowth] admits that he can't use [Pay Day]. Everyone is shocked, and the elder believes that [Meowth] needs battle experience to recall how to use [Pay Day]. Even though [Meowth] argues that it won’t work, the villagers are adamant and take him to the stadium. 
At the stadium, a huge crowd watches as they send out a [Nidoking] to fight [Meowth]. [Meowth] can only run around and avoid [Nidoking], exhausting him. They check for coins, but [Meowth] still hasn’t produced any. They continue the training by sending out an [Onix]. The [Onix] knocks [Meowth] around and locks it in a [Bind] attack. [Jessie] and [James], disguised as part of the villagers, watch their friend get hurt and decide to help [Meowth]. [Meowth] is bruised and battered, locked in [Onix]’s grasp, when suddenly a coin smacks into [Onix]. Coins begin to fly out onto the battlefield, and the villagers begin to gather the money. In actuality, [Jessie] was throwing her coins out onto the field. [James] has no money, but he throws his three favorite gold bottle caps out there before they leave. 
The villagers thank [Meowth] for the coins, believing the prophecy has come true. They want [Meowth] to stay and rule them. [Meowth] is still shocked at how it happened as he looks at the coins. He notices the gold bottle cap atop the stack and realizes what [Jessie] and [James] did for him. [Meowth] tears up and runs away to the beach, trying to find [Jessie] and [James]. [Jessie] and [James] listen nearby as [Meowth] admits how close they are. The villagers want him to stay and [Meowth] comes clean. [Jessie] and [James] step out and forgive [Meowth]. They all jump aboard the [Magikarp] submarine and leave, against the villagers' will. Meanwhile, [Ash] and friends continue along, unaware of what really happened on the island. [Jessie] and [James] decide to make another attempt at giving [Meowth] battle experience to learn [Pay Day], which shocks [Meowth].


[Ash] and his friends arrive on [[Murcott] Island]. At the beach, [Ash] recalls his [Lapras] as [Tracey] brings out [Marill] and [Venonat], excited to visit the island. [Misty] ducks at a passing [Beedrill] due to her fear of bugs. [Tracey] reveals that the island is famous for housing plenty of [Bug] types. [Misty] wants to stay on the beach to avoid exploring as [Ash] tells [Tracey] of her fear. [Tracey] taunts her by calling her a chicken, persuading her to follow. 
The group walks along as [[Tracey]'s [Pokémon]] sense something nearby. [Tracey] uses his binoculars to spot a group of [Caterpie]. [Ash] wants to catch one, but [Misty] pulls him away. [Tracey] warns her of a [Pokémon] in her path as she stumbles across a hiding [Pinsir], sending [Misty] running the other way. They continue along and [[Tracey]'s [Pokémon]] spot something else. [Tracey] follows as they come across a badly injured [Scyther] on the ground, nearly passed out from exhaustion. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] as [Tracey] steps forward to treat it. [Scyther] wakes up as [Tracey] tries to use a [Potion], jumping back and assuming a battle position, but it is too weak to fight, barely able to stand. [Ash] steps forward to try to catch it. He throws a [[Poké] Ball], but [Scyther] swats it away, falling to its knees before struggling back up. [Ash] attempts to send [Pikachu] to battle, but [Tracey] steps in with his [Venonat]. [Tracey] orders a [[Sleep] Powder] attack. [Scyther] tries to fly away and avoid the attack, but it falls back down, the attack hitting and putting it to sleep. [Tracey] tosses a [[Poké] Ball], easily catching [Scyther]. 
[Team Rocket] is flying over the island in their balloon surveying the land. A [Beedrill] flies towards them and cuts through the balloon, bringing it down. [Team Rocket] gets out of the wreck and notices all the bug [Pokémon] around. They stumble across a [Scyther] swarm. The leader, denoted by two cuts forming a cross on its forehead, leads an attack on [Team Rocket].
At the [[Pokémon] Center], [Nurse Joy] and [Chansey] work on [Scyther]. [Ash] and his friends watch through the window as [Scyther] glares at [Tracey], seemingly mad at being caught. [Chansey] brings [Scyther] out of the room and takes it to recovery. Joy concludes that it lost its swarm leadership position from battling a younger [Scyther] challenger. The loss forced it to leave the swarm and live in exile unless it wins another leadership match. [Ash] calls [Professor [Oak]], the professor commending [Tracey]. [Oak] points out that [Scyther]'s self-esteem is probably low due to losing leadership and being caught. [Oak] suggests to [Tracey] to try to heal [Scyther]’s mood and get it back in shape.
[Team Rocket] managed to outrun the [Scyther] swarm, but not without hits. [Meowth] and [James] notify [Jessie] that her hair was crudely cut short. After checking it, she is clearly outraged, wanting to confront the [Scyther]. [Meowth] stops her to help plan a method to capture the entire swarm. Meanwhile, [Tracey] tries to help [Scyther] recover, but it is resistant. [Ash] knows [Scyther] loves battling and that [Tracey] should work to help [Scyther] prepare for a rematch. 
[Team Rocket] watches the [Scyther] swarm resting at a pond. [Jessie] fires a bazooka loaded with yellow glue into the air, coming down and immobilizing the swarm. [Meowth] fires a net as the swarm cries out. [Scyther] hears the cry as Joy removes its bandages. [Scyther] flies up and crashes through the window, heading away. It crashes back to the earth, still weak. [Tracey] tries to stop [Scyther], but it resists and flies away. [Tracey] and his friends follow.
[Team Rocket] has the [Scyther] swarm in a net, [Jessie] beside herself in anger as she taunts the swarm. [[Tracey]'s [Scyther]] cuts them loose and steps forward to confront [Team Rocket]. [Ash] and the others arrive, noticing [Jessie]’s hair and quickly making fun of her. Furious, [Jessie] brings out [Arbok] and [Lickitung] while [James] brings out [Weezing] and [Victreebel]. [Ash] sends out [Pikachu] as [Weezing] uses [SmokeScreen] to cover the field. [Scyther] blows it away with [Swords Dance], but it is still exhausted. [Meowth] translates that [Scyther] came back not to challenge the leader but to protect its brethren. [Team Rocket]'s [Pokémon] outnumber [Scyther] four to one and [Pikachu] tries to step in, but [Scyther] wards him away. [Ash] tries to order [Pikachu] in, but [Tracey] stops him to allow [Scyther] to prove itself. 
[Meowth] even joins the [Pokémon] to attack, leading the charge, but [Scyther] easily swats him away. [Lickitung] and [Victreebel] try to hit [Scyther] in a pincer attack, but [Scyther] flies up, [Victreebel] biting [Lickitung]. [Arbok] attacks from underneath [Scyther], but [Scyther] uses [Double Team] to throw [Arbok] off, sending it back to the ground. [Scyther] lands and tries to rest as [Victreebel] attacks with [Razor Leaf]. [Scyther] stops the attack with its scythes as [Tracey] reveals how he knew [Victreebel] would use the move. [Arbok] attacks with [Poison Sting] as [Scyther] dodges. It collapses, low on stamina and unable to dodge the second [Poison Sting]. The new leader steps forward to stop the attack. The two [Scyther] team up and attack [Team Rocket] with [Slash] attacks against their [Pokémon]. [Jessie] tries to fire a bazooka, but [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] stops her with [Thunderbolt]. [Scyther] attacks [Team Rocket] and leaves them with mohawks. [Team Rocket] retreats.
The [Scyther] swarm washes off the glue as the new leader and [[Tracey]'s [Scyther]] give respect to each other. The swarm departs as [[Tracey]'s [Scyther]] regains its confidence, joining [Tracey]. [Tracey] officially announces his catch as [Ash] tries to correct his style to resemble how [Ash] celebrates his catches.


[Ash] and his friends sail onboard [Lapras], but all of them seem bored. [Pikachu] points to a nearby island, which they mark as their destination. As they head for it, [Jigglypuff] surfaces nearby. They touch down in a cove as [Pikachu] and [Togepi] run off while the humans take in the island scenery. [Misty] sends out her [Goldeen] and [Staryu] to play, along with [[Ash]'s [Lapras]]. A piece of fruit hits [Ash] in the head as they see a [Farfetch'd] flying above them. A whole flock takes off from the island as [Tracey] sketches them. [Pikachu] and [Togepi] return with some fruit as [Pikachu] points to all the fruit trees. [Ash] and [Misty] take a bit of the yellow fruit, finding them sour. [Tracey] finds some darker ones that are riper. The group decides to rest for the day on the island as a vacation. [Ash] brings out his [Pokémon], his [Snorlax] and [Charizard] quickly going to sleep. [Tracey] brings out his [Pokémon]. [Misty] brings out [Psyduck], but it is already out. [Scyther] shows off its strength, scaring some of the [Pokémon]. [Togepi] is not afraid, walking up to [Scyther] and playing. Everyone else soon follows. [Ash] calls to [Charizard] to greet, but it looks away. [Ash] walks closer as [Charizard] uses [Flamethrower] on [Ash]. The attack also heads toward [Scyther], but it deflects it with its scythes. [Charizard] notices as [Scyther] steps closer. [Charizard] stands up, as the two seem ready to fight. [Ash] stops them as the two turn away.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is also taking their vacation on the island. [Jessie] decides to not steal any [Pokémon], but when she spots [Togepi] playing with [Marill] nearby, [Lapras] eating algae, and [Goldeen] and [Staryu] swimming, they realize that [Ash] and his friends are nearby. [Ash]’s group enjoys the break as [Team Rocket] observes nearby, deciding to poach all the [Pokémon]. 
[Ash] and co. bring back fruit as [Snorlax] attempts to eat the pile, but [Scyther] wards him away. Inside the pile, [Jigglypuff] pops out and sings, putting everyone to sleep. As usual, [Jigglypuff] stops, gets angry and draws on everyone. 
When everyone wakes up, they decide to let [Snorlax] sleep longer while they continue preparing. The [Pokémon] enjoy their share of fruit as everyone realizes how much they need the vacation. [Tracey] brings fruit sandwiches to the table as [Misty] is curious about the new food style. [Snorlax] comes up and takes the entire plate, sliding the contents into its mouth. It goes back to sleep, leaving everyone else to clean the dishes. [Tracey] notices that [Snorlax] doesn't eat as much now due to less energy exertion. [Misty] slams [Ash] for not really training [Snorlax]. [Togepi] seems happy playing with [Marill]'s tail. [Scyther] flexes its power while training in the middle of the pond, [Charizard] watching with intent.
At night, everyone is asleep, but [Pikachu] wakes up and notices [Ash] is not there. [Ash] is out on the beach, speculating about the [GS Ball], comparing it to a normal [[Poké] Ball]. [Pikachu] comes over as they watch the stars bright and clear. [Ash] pulls out his two [Badges] and remembers how different [Cissy] and [Danny] were as [[Gym] Leaders] compared to the [Kanto] [[Gym] Leaders], reflecting on his wins for the [Coral Eye [Badge]] and [Sea [Ruby] [Badge]], wondering about the next one. 
Back at the camp, [Tracey] talks in his sleep about finding and sketching the Legendary birds. [Misty] wakes up to his talking, but a [[Sleep] Powder] attack over the camp silences all but [Charizard] and [Scyther]. [[James]'s [Victreebel]] stops sending the powder as [Jessie] fires a bazooka, capturing everyone with suction plugs. [Meowth] tries to reel them all in, but [Snorlax] is too heavy to drag. [Scyther] slashes the rope as [Charizard] steps up to aid. The powerful [Pokémon] roar battle cries, waking the camp and getting [Ash] and [Pikachu] to return. [Team Rocket] rappels in on a zip-line reciting their motto, crashing into a tree before they can finish, which makes them say their final lines incoherently due to being stunned from the impact. [Meowth] jumps in and gets them in line with scratches to the face. 
[Team Rocket] sends out [Arbok] and [Weezing] as [Ash] sends [Pikachu]. [Weezing]'s [SmokeScreen] covers the field, but [Scyther]'s [Swords Dance] clears it and sends [Weezing] flying. [Bulbasaur], [Squirtle] and [Pikachu] take turns using [Vine Whip], [[Water] Gun] and [ThunderShock] to attack [Team Rocket]. [Charizard] follows up with [Flamethrower] as [Scyther] uses [Skull Bash] to send them blasting off. [Ash] congratulates the [Pokémon] as they watch [Charizard] and [Scyther] walk away in an informal respect motion. 
The next day, [Ash] brings out [Lapras] as everyone departs the island with refreshed spirits. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] winds up stuck on a small rock island. They try to relax as a [Farfetch'd] comes up. They find out the small rock holds the [Farfetch'd] flock. They all smack [Team Rocket] with their sticks.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] are on [Mandarin Island], and [Ash] is on a winning streak. He finishes off a [Butterfree] with [Bulbasaur]'s [Razor Leaf]. [Ash] starts to get a bit full of himself, then lets known the fact that he is hungry. [Misty] and [Tracey] then gets something to eat.
As [Ash] and [Misty] eat, [Tracey] tells them that [Prima] (known in the games as [Lorelei]) is going to give a lecture on the island. [Misty] is ecstatic, and tells [Ash] and [Tracey] that [Prima] is her hero. She hears a voice behind her, and turns to see [Prima] herself! [Misty] and [Tracey] introduce themselves while [Ash] chokes on his sandwich. She walks past them, however, and bends down to look at [Togepi].
Nearby, [Meowth] watches from the bushes while [Jessie] and [James] eat. They peer through their binoculars, and [James] recognizes [Prima]. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember who she is. [Prima] looks out at the ocean, and makes many philosophical comments about nature. But all [Ash] wants is a battle. But [Prima] continues to ignore him. [Ash] interprets this to mean that she's afraid to battle and goes off in search of someone else. He does find an opponent who accepts his challenge. As [Prima] watches, [Ash] offers to let the boy set up the rules and they agree on two [Pokémon] each. [Ash] sends out [Squirtle], and the boy releases a [Persian].
[Squirtle] uses [[Water] Gun], but [Persian] dodges it. It unleashes a [Thunderbolt] attack, but [Squirtle] uses [Withdraw]. [Squirtle] then pops out of its shell and [Skull Bashes] [Persian], and knocks it out. The boy then sends out a [Tauros], who [Tackles] [Squirtle] right away knocking it out. [Ash] withdraws [Squirtle] and sends out [Charizard], but [Ash] still cannot control [Charizard] and it burns him.
[Prima] continues to watch as [Tauros] uses [Take Down]. [Charizard] then uses [Flamethrower], knocking out [Tauros] in one hit. He then flies into the air and attempts to burn everything in sight. [Ash] tries to call it back, but the beam from the [[Poké] Ball] misses. When [Ash] gets Flamethrowered again, [Prima] is forced to intervene, sending out her [Slowbro], who uses [Disable], immobilizing [Charizard] in midair. It then brings it down to the ground, and [Ash] succeeds in calling it back. [Prima] asks [Ash] if he knows what he's doing, and he defends himself by saying that he was in the top sixteen in the [[Indigo Plateau] Conference]. [Prima] isn't impressed and starts to leave. She turns and asks them all to come to her demonstration later. They enthusiastically accept.
Later, [Ash] and his friends watch [Prima] battle from the stands of [Mandarin Island] Stadium. [Team Rocket] has also snuck in dressed as food vendors. [James] now fully recognizes [Prima], and they plan to steal her [Pokémon]. The demonstration goes on for a while and [Prima] defeats every [Pokémon] she goes up against. [Ash] watches intently, determined to try to pick up some tips. After the demonstration, [Prima] invites [Ash] and his friends to her house for some tea. As [Misty] and [Tracey] thank her for inviting them and rave about her [Pokémon], [Ash] sits in silence. Suddenly, he speaks up and announces his suspicions that [Prima] is trying to teach him reverse psychology (or perverse psychology, as he calls it). [Prima] tells them that every person has a particular way of acting in and out of battle. She explains to them that she is like the water. She usually "goes with the flow", but when she's in battle, she becomes as cold as ice. She walks outside, and tells [Ash] that the most important thing is knowing where his strength lies. [Ash] may be strong in some ways, but he needs to develop what comes from the inside.
[Ash] then once again challenges [Prima] to a battle which she accepts. They agree on one [Pokémon] each, and send out their [Pokémon]. [Ash] uses [Pikachu], and [Prima] chooses [Cloyster]. [Pikachu] uses [Thunderbolt], but [Cloyster] [Withdraws] into its shell. As a result the attack has no effect. [Pikachu] uses [Agility], but is knocked back by [Cloyster]'s [Reflect] attack. [Pikachu] uses [Thunder] which hits but then [Cloyster] starts to glow red. [Tracey] warns [Ash] that this is [Rage], which increases its Attack level. [Pikachu] tries a [Quick Attack], but is pummeled by [Aurora Beam] and [Take Down]. [Ash] loses.
[Prima] calls back [Cloyster], and looks at [Pikachu] to see if he is okay. She tells [Ash] that he has the skills he needs to be a [[Pokémon] Master], but he needs to remember that his [Pokémon] are the ones who win the [Badges]. She tells him that with his [Pokémon] and friends at his side, he'll always succeed. She then tells him that if he wins all the [[Gym] [Badges]] in the [Orange League], he'll be presented with an "Honorable [Trainer]" trophy. [Ash] then thanks [Prima].
Suddenly, voices sound from above. It's [Team Rocket], and they ask if [Prima] has a recording of her lecture on a CD. She replies that it's on tape only, and whispers to [Ash] and his friends that it's $18.95. [Team Rocket] falls out of their balloon, then says their motto. [Misty] correctly guesses that their original plan was to steal [Prima]'s [Pokémon], but they tell her that they figured they'd lose. They then decided to stick with the program and steal [Pikachu]. [Ash] gets ready to fight, but [Prima] tells him that she'll take care of it.
She sends out [Jynx], who uses [Ice Punch] and freezes [Team Rocket]. [Jynx] then uses [Blizzard] and blows them into the sky. The pieces from the ice block rain down, making sparkles in the sky. Everyone watches, amazed. That evening, [Prima] tells [Ash] that the nearest [Gym] is on [[Trovita] Island], which is straight across the bay on the other side of [Mandarin Island]. [Ash] and his friends thank [Prima] again for everything that she taught him. They wave farewell, and head towards their next adventure.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] arrive in [Yambera], an old looking town where they meet a young [Trainer] by the name of [Emily]. She is looking for her female Nidoran by the name of Maria with an orange ribbon around her neck. She asks if the gang has seen her. [Ash] looks up his [Pokédex] and gets a picture of the male one and then eventually the female one. She pleads with them to help her and they agree.
After the gang search for a little while, save for [Pikachu] who finds a tree full of delicious pink fruit, [Ash] and [Misty] eventually bump into [Ralph], another kid from the town who has a similar problem as before. He is looking for Tony, a male Nidoran with a blue and purple ribbon. [Ash] looks up the male Nidoran in his [Pokédex] and gets the data. [Tracey] eventually comes back with [Emily] asking if they have found Maria yet and [Ralph] calls her a kidnapper. Both [Ralph] and [Emily] begin to argue over their two [Pokémon].
[[Tracey]'s [Marill]] comes back and points to where both Nidoran are located. [Ralph] and [Emily] are overjoyed and literally run over [Tracey] to get to them. The gang follows them to a flower garden, where they find both Nidoran cuddling into each other. [Tracey] and [Misty] immediately realize what is going on but [Ash], as usual, is clueless. Both [Pokémon] act very romantic but shortly after are taken away by their [Trainers]. Both [Ralph] and [Emily] insult the others Nidoran.
[Ash], [Misty] and [Tracey] go to a sandwich bar and talk to the owner who tells them [Ralph] and [Emily]’s story. They both knew each other since they were children and competed in many of the same contests and caught many of the same [Pokémon]; this led to their own two Nidoran falling in love. However, with [Ralph] and [Emily] hating each other they could not be together.
The gang leaves the sandwich bar at sunset when they spot a Nidoran running in front of them, revealed to be Tony, and he vanishes into a group of buildings. Tony is seen calling up to a window when Maria comes out to see him. [Misty] realizes that Tony is “sweet talking” up to the window. [Ash] asks how she knows this but [Misty] merely tells him that he is not mature enough to understand. Tony and Maria continue talking to each other until [Emily] appears at the window and dunks him with a pail of water. [Ralph] eventually finds Tony soaking and takes him back to his house, which is right next to [Emily]’s house. [Misty] vows to do something about the situation but [Ash] tells her that it is none of her business. [Misty] brushes him off. [Team Rocket] is in the bushes listening in on the situation and vows to capture the two.
Later during the night [Misty] is writing letters, one for [Emily] and one for [Ralph] from each other. [Misty] and [Ash] end up arguing but they turn on [Tracey] when he says that they should be together. [Jessie] plots to have [Meowth] convince Tony and Maria to come away with [Team Rocket] by tricking them into thinking that it is the only way to be together. [Jessie] also gives off a bit of her love life trials only to have [Meowth] call her a nut job to which [Jessie] boots him and [James]. [Meowth] goes first to Maria and then to Tony to try to convince them to come with him. His plan failed  because as much as they love each other they would never abandon their [Trainers]. [Jessie] comes up with another plan to which [James] and [Meowth] do not have much enthusiasm.
The gang is next seen waiting in the bushes to see the fruits of [Misty]’s plan. [Emily], [Ralph] and their Nidoran come into the park where they both accuse each other of sending the other a stupid gift and letter. [Misty] sent [Ralph] a toy plane and [Emily] a bouquet of flowers. However [Ralph] throws up when flying in planes and [Emily] was allergic to [Misty]’s flowers. Both start fighting once again. They are interrupted when [Team Rocket] shows up, cross-dressing as a newly-wed bride and groom. They soon reveal themselves and grab Tony and Maria before saying their motto on top of a giant wedding cake. Inside the cake they reveal their balloon and make their escape. [Misty] scolds [Emily] and [Ralph] for fighting and arguing, saying that it was their fault that their [Pokémon] were stolen. [Ash] and [Tracey] notice some cans that fell from [Team Rocket]’s balloon and they follow them.
[Team Rocket] attempts to dress up Maria and Tony despite their squirming only to have the gang find them thanks to the cans. Tony and Maria make their escape but [Jessie] commands [Arbok] to attack. [Ralph] and [Emily] command them to use their tackle attacks which knocks [Arbok] back. [James] joins in and calls out [Victreebel] who eats [Jessie]’s head this time. Maria uses [Scratch] on [Victreebel] while Tony gets knocked back by [Arbok]. The battle ensues equal sided until [Victreebel] traps Tony and Maria rescues him. Both [Ralph] and [Emily] find out that both [Pokémon] are fighting for one another. Both Nidoran beat back [Arbok] and [Victreebel] by using double attacks like [Double Kick]. [Ralph] and [Emily] say their attack names together this time without minding each other.
[Team Rocket] tries to make their escape and catch the Nidoran by using one of their many giant vacuums. It goes amiss when [Pikachu] uses a branch to get to their balloon to avoid being blown in. [Pikachu] uses his [Thunderbolt] and destroys the vacuum. [Misty] calls out [Staryu] who bursts [Team Rocket]’s balloon and they go blasting off once again. [Misty] gets on to [Ralph] and [Emily] to make them realize what they did wrong. Both of them finally listen and decide what’s best for their [Pokémon]. Tony and Maria finally kiss and in doing so evolve into [Nidorina] and [Nidorino]. [Tracey] sketches it but also wonders what made them evolve, their battle or their kiss. [Misty] hits him with his drawing. [Ash] asks if people change with their kiss. [Misty] says back to him that they should find out for themselves.
At the end [Team Rocket] is seen being rung with [Arbok] and [Victreebel] on the church bells.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] are walking along [Mandarin Island] to the [Gym] in [Trovita] in the blazing sun. [Misty] and [Ash] are not doing too well but [Tracey] seems fine. They find out that being on [Lapras] they don’t do much walking. [Tracey] tells them that they can be at the town in three days.
A storm rolls on the gang and they desperately run to find some shelter but [Misty] falls to the ground with [Togepi]. They take cover under a rock until lightning almost hits them. During the storm they see a small crowd of [Magnemite] being struck by lightning and wonder what they are doing. They are absorbing the lightning. Eventually they see a [Jolteon] who seems to be herding the crowd of [Magnemite]. They also meet a man who has a wagon with a pair of [Tauros] pulling it who offers them safety in the back of the wagon from the lightning; they do so and board the wagon. They see the [Magnemite] absorbing more lightning.
Later on after the storm, the man who calls himself [Ethan], tells them that he owns a [Magnemite] ranch. He takes his [Magnemite] into lightning storms so that he can take the electric power to towns and cities on the island. [Tracey] notices how well trained the [Magnemite] are and asks [Ethan] about it. [Ethan] calls the [Magnemite] by numbers instead of names and [Misty] and [Ash] comment that they cannot tell them apart but [Ethan] says he can. He uses [Jolteon] to “round up” the [Magnemite] like sheep. The [Magnemite] take a liking to [Pikachu] with him being an [[Electric]-type] [Pokémon] and in doing so they almost swallow him. [Ash] attempts to help [Pikachu] but ends up getting shocked himself. [Ethan] comments that [Ash] is a “tough little hombre” just like he is for taking the electric attack.
[Jolteon] leads the [Magnemite] and [Ethan] takes the gang to the next town. At sunset, [Ash] takes the reigns from [Ethan] to the [Tauros] but almost crashes it on his first try. However, he eventually gets the hang of it. Later at night during a thunderstorm, the gang watches as the [Magnemite] absorb more lightning from the storm.
The following day, the gang relaxes around a campfire with [Ethan] and enjoys some drinks and snacks. What they do not notice is that they are being watched by [Team Rocket]. They plot to kidnap [Pikachu], [Jolteon] and the group of [Magnemite] and profit off their electrical power before giving them to [Giovanni]. [Ethan] receives a phone call from [Officer Jenny] in a nearby town telling them that they need power due to a blackout. The phone call is interrupted soon after and the [Magnemite] soon fly away with [Jolteon] in pursuit.
They run into [Team Rocket] who do their motto as usual and announce their intentions. Using a giant magnet they plan to kidnap the [Magnemite]. They also use a giant gripper to kidnap [Pikachu] and [Jolteon]. [Pikachu] tries to use [ThunderShock] but it does no damage due to the gripper being lightning absorbent. [Ethan] commands [Jolteon] instead to use [Pin Missile] which works much better by letting both [Pokémon] free. [Jolteon] lands on his feet but [Pikachu] on his back. [Jolteon] uses [[Thunder] Wave] to battle with the magnet for control of the group of [Magnemite], but [Jessie] goes into a rage and calls out [Arbok] who falls to the ground. [Jolteon] manages to get all the [Magnemite] free, but in doing so left himself open to a [Tackle] attack from [Arbok]. [Jolteon] flies back into [Ethan] who in turn hurts his arm on a rock. [Pikachu] manages to finish the battle by using [Thunderbolt] on [Team Rocket] sending them flying off and saving the group of [Pokémon].
Both [Jolteon] and [Ethan] are seriously hurt due to the fight but [Ethan] makes it a point that he must take the [Magnemite] to the town for their electric power. [Misty] and [Tracey] plead for him not to go but it is only when [Ash] says that he will take the [Magnemite] to town for [Ethan]. [Ash] straps up one of the [Tauros] and [Ethan] tells him to take nine of the [Magnemite] to the town. [Ash] and [Pikachu] ride on [Tauros] to the town with the [Magnemite]. Using the whistle which controls the [Magnemite], [Ash] does pretty well until the [Magnemite] start vanishing in different directions. When the whistle fails to bring them back [Pikachu] uses [Thunderbolt] doing the very same thing as [Jolteon] normally does. [Ash] counts the [Magnemite] in order to check if they are all there. He finds that “Number 6”, a very strange looking [Magnemite], is missing and he goes off to look for it.
Number 6 is floating away over the stream when it is found by [Ash] but not only by him but also by [Team Rocket], back for a second round. Using magnet machines that are powered by rubbing themselves with panels that work on static electricity, they once again plan to capture the [Magnemite]. [Ash] runs away with Number 6 until he runs into [Pikachu], leading [Team Rocket] to the other [Magnemite] in the process. [Ash] orders [Pikachu] to run with the other [Magnemite] but he does not. The other [Magnemite] are bagged by [Team Rocket] but [Pikachu] tries to battle back with his own electric attacks against [Team Rocket]’s magnets.
Seeing [Pikachu] trying desperately to save its fellow [Magnemite], Number 6 flies into the colliding magnetic blasts. Absorbing all the electricity, it manages to free the other [Magnemite] and evolve into [Magneton]. The other eight [Magnemite] use their own power to restore [Pikachu]. [Team Rocket] tries to get the [Pokémon] back with their magnets by rubbing themselves harder but they accidentally set themselves on fire instead. [Pikachu], the [Magnemite] and Number 6 use their combined power to shock [Team Rocket] which once again sends them blasting off.
At sunset, [Ash] and the group arrive in the town followed shortly by [Tracey] who is leading the wagon with [Misty] and [Ethan]. They arrive to find the town once again with power. They enter the town.
Later at the [[Pokémon] Center] [Ash] is thanked by [Nurse Joy] and [Officer Jenny] for his help and also is asked by [Ethan] to join him in his job. [Ash] declines saying that he would much rather stay on his course for the [Orange League]. They leave the town and go on toward [Trovita].


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] are walking through a mountainous desert region that looks like Monument Valley.  [Ash] is tired and hungry. He offers to eat if his companions are tired and hungry too. [Tracey] then calls to [Ash] and [Misty] to see what he is seeing. They run up to [Tracey], and they discover that they have come upon the awesome metropolis that is the city of [Trovitopolis], the largest city on [[Mandarin Island] South]. 
[Jessie], [James], and [Meowth]  spy on [Ash] and his friends as this time, they have cooked up what they think is the perfect plan, in which they are actually standing a large trap, as they have put dynamite under the ground and once detonated, they will have trapped [Pikachu]. [Meowth] prepares to activate a trap button. But it doesn't work. [Meowth] wonders where the explosion is, and then the ground disappears underneath them and they fall into a dark hole as deep as an ocean abyss! [Misty] is heard screaming. [Tracey] wonders why anybody would be screaming. Suddenly, the ground starts to crack and it collapses right underneath them, and they too fall into a hole as deep and dark as an ocean trench!
[Ash] and [Misty] are woken up by [Pikachu] and [Togepi], but [Tracey] is stuck in some rubble. So [Ash], [Misty], and [Pikachu] pull him out. The group looks down the cave, all stand up and start to walk down the cave. As [Ash] and friends are walking through the sewer, a bell-ringing sound is heard somewhere. Then, a [Vine Whip] comes from the water and taps on [Ash]'s shoulder. [Ash] thinks that it was [Pikachu] and begs him to stop. [Pikachu] isn't on [Ash]'s shoulder, but on the ground in front of him. Another vine appears and the group sees this. [Ash] commands [Pikachu] to use [ThunderShock], but [Misty] states that if [Pikachu] uses an electric attack, everyone will be shocked, so [Ash] sends out [Bulbasaur]. He tells it to use [Razor Leaf], but the creature hits the leaves away, and then grabs [Bulbasaur] and pulls it into the sewer water! [Ash] attempts to jump in after it, but [Misty], [Tracey] and [Pikachu] hold him back. [Tracey] points out that he will be dragged down too, but [Ash] does not care and still attempts to jump in to save him, As they struggle for a while, and [Officer Jenny] comes in with a light up near him Jenny explains that the sewer is very dangerous and throws a rope down to them. But [Ash] refuses, wanting to find [Bulbasaur], so [Misty] and [Tracey] tie him up and Jenny then hoists him.
[Ash] and friends are thrown in jail and [Ash] bangs on the cell door. [Misty] and [Tracey] wonder why they were thrown in jail for walking in the sewers. Jenny comes in to inform them they are free to go. Then a large man with a large mustache enters, and hopes that Jenny is not releasing them. Jenny then acknowledges the [[Mayor] of [Trovitopolis]]'s presence. She tells him that they only arrived in town today and are going to the [[Pokémon] [Gym]] on [[Trovita] Island], and that their story checks out. The [Mayor] can't have this incident leaking out yet and says she should keep them locked up until the next week. Jenny tells him that she can't hold them if they aren't charged with a crime. The [Mayor] has to accept that because it is the law, but he orders them not to say anything about the creature. But [Ash] tells the [Mayor] that all he wants to do is get [Bulbasaur] back. This makes the [Mayor] lose his temper and threaten to have them all arrested for endangering public safety. Jenny reveals to them that they are not the first people to have seen the creature. The [Mayor] is reluctant, but Jenny tells them anyway. She reveals to them that the police force has had a number of reported encounters with a mysterious creature in the sewers, but no serious injuries reported. She then tells them that the [Mayor] says people will panic if word gets out about the creature, because they will never be able to capture it. [Ash] asks why, and Jenny reveals that there are almost 500 miles of sewer under the city, and over 5,000 manholes. The [Mayor] then says that is why they have to take drastic and immediate action to ensure the safety of everyone in the city. He also says that there is an election next week and if word gets out that he is letting a monster roam the sewers then he won't stand a chance. [Nurse Joy] comes in and tells him that she has heard what he intends to do about the sewer creature problem. The [Mayor] tells her that is his business, and group ask [Nurse Joy] about his plan. She tells them that instead of capturing the creature so it can be studied, the [Mayor] intends to send a SWAT team down to the sewers to destroy it. [Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] respond by saying the [Mayor]'s plan is cruel and that it could be a whole new species of [Pokémon]. The [Mayor] says that any talk of any such plan is pure speculation, and that there is no evidence. Jenny tells him that such a plan is illegal and the police force don't know anything about it. The [Mayor] loses his temper again and proclaims that he is the [Mayor], he is responsible for the city and he will do what he sees fit for the city.
At the [[Pokémon] Center], the group speak to [Professor [Oak]] about the new species. [Ash] asks [Oak] what they should do, and [Oak] says that there has to be some way of preventing the [Mayor] from destroying the creature. [Nurse Joy] does not think so, because the only thing the [Mayor] cares about is being re-elected, and he's not going to let anything get in his way. The group see dozens of campaign posters all over building walls and park fences, and see a statue of the [Mayor]. The group notice "M" symbol on the foundation of the statue, and recognize it from all the campaign posters they saw earlier. [Ash] has had enough and decides to return to the sewers to search for [Bulbasaur]. The group finds that [Mayor] is briefing his SWAT Team inside the sewer. [Ash] knows how to find an entrance.
[Nurse Joy] gave them another entrance to the sewer on the other side of the city. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] ends up tired after falling into the sewers at the beginning of the episode. All [Meowth] wants to do is eat, but [James] says there is nothing to eat down where they are. They hear the same bell-ringing sound, and the creature reappears and starts rubbing [Meowth]'s chin. [Meowth] mistakenly think that [Jessie] or [James] rubbed him, but he finds that it wasn't them. The creature appears and [Team Rocket] run away in panic. [Team Rocket] ends up exhausted again. They then hear footsteps, and a flashlight is pointed at them. [James] sends out his [Weezing] and commands it to use [SmokeScreen], as it engulfs the sewer with smoke. [Team Rocket] then make their getaway, screaming in fear. It turns out that [Ash] was holding the flashlight and [Misty] and [Tracey] are there too. [Ash] asks if everyone is alright, then [Misty] notices that [Togepi] is missing. They spot [Togepi] at the end of the path. [Misty] chases after it, and she picks up [Togepi]. The creature appears and grabs [Togepi] and pulls him on the sewer water! [Misty] tries to water to save him, but [Ash] and [Tracey] pull her. [Ash] decided to use his secret weapon he asked [Professor [Oak]] to send him; [Muk]. [Muk] [Body [Slams]] [Ash] in affection. 
Meanwhile [Team Rocket] is exhausted for a second time. [Jessie] and [James] decided to use a scary disguise. [Jessie] split her hair in two, and [Meowth] is biting onto [James]'s head. They then come across none other than the [Mayor]'s SWAT team. The Squad Leader radios in to the [Mayor], and tells him that they have discovered 3 unidentified creatures. The [Mayor] compliments them on their excellent work, and commands them to attack immediately. The SWAT open fire at [Team Rocket] with puddy guns, running away in the process.
The scene cuts back to [Ash] and [Tracey], with [Muk] in front. They come to a dead end, and [Muk] points out that they have to go into the underwater tunnel to find [Misty], [Togepi] and [Bulbasaur]. [Ash] and [Tracey] jump in and swim down the tunnel and reach the end, where the creature appears and attacks the companions!
The SWAT team has come out of the sewer and reported back to the [Mayor]. They tell him they couldn't find a creature that matched the original description, but found 3 other creatures down there. The leader comes to the conclusion that the sewer could be infested with freaks like the ones they saw. The [Mayor] grows increasingly paranoid and orders that every manhole to be sealed and seal off the sewer. 
The group wakes up and sees an opening into the city. They also see [Misty] and [Bulbasaur]. [Tracey] found the creature, who actually is a giant [Bulbasaur]. He has been living down there for a long time and was actually using [Vine Whip]. [Ash] notices that it has the [Mayor]'s symbol on its collar.
Back at the [Mayor]'s office in the City Hall, [Nurse Joy] explains to him why sending his SWAT team to seal all the sewer exits is a bad idea. She explains that [Ash] and his friends are in the sewers and they'll be trapped there if all the exits are sealed. The [Mayor] assures Joy that he will remove all the concrete as soon as the election is over. Later, while [Mayor] is taking a bath, an earthquake starts, then water forcefully erupts from the floor right under the [Mayor]'s bathtub. The bathroom, the City Hall and the entire town are flooded. [Ash] asks if the giant [Bulbasaur] looked familiar to the [Mayor]. He sees his trademark "M" initial on [Bulbasaur]'s collar and explained that he abandoned his [Bulbasaur] in the sewer because it wouldn't evolve. Upon learning this, the [Mayor]'s [Bulbasaur] grabs him with [Vine Whip]. [Misty] and [Tracey] tell him how dare he abandon it, yet it's happy to see him. Many people are seeing the [Mayor] half-naked and he becomes very embarrassed. [Ash] and friends order him to apologize to his [Pokémon] for what he did, but he refuses. The SWAT team arrives, and the [Mayor] orders them to open fire on [Bulbasaur]. However, [Ash] steps in and commands [Pikachu] to use [Thunderbolt] on them and his [Bulbasaur] to use [Vine Whip] on them, which sends the SWAT team flying off. The [Mayor] says that he will offer a truce with his [Bulbasaur], but [Bulbasaur] spins him around and throws him into his statue, toppling it and his chances in the election next week.
Later, [Officer Jenny] thanks [Ash] and friends for their help, and [Nurse Joy] says that she will take care of the giant [Bulbasaur] at the [[Pokémon] Center]. When [Ash] asks about where [[Trovita] Island] is, Joy points it out, which is almost far away.
Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] has found an exit from the sewer system, but it has bars on it and they realize they are trapped. [Jessie] sneezes and breaks the metal bars, setting them free.


Getting a ferry from [Trovitopolis], [Ash], [Pikachu], [Misty], [Togepi], and [Tracey] are finally going to make it to [[Trovita] Island], which is surrounded by whirlpools and huge spiked rocks. [Ash] is determined to get his third [Orange League] [[Gym] [Badge]]. Suddenly, [Pikachu] spots a little girl and a [Seel] caught in the strong current, crying for help. [Misty] jumps into action by sending out [Staryu] and then swims down to rescue the girl. [Ash] joins in by sending out [Lapras] and helping [Misty] bring the girl over to the island. Meanwhile, a young man has been watching the whole thing, and is impressed by [Misty]'s actions.
[Team Rocket] is not too far behind, and their submarine gets caught in one of the whirlpools.
While riding [Lapras] the rest of the way to [[Trovita] Island], [Ash] and [Misty] ask the girl what she was doing out on the current. The girl, who introduces herself as [Mahri], says that she and her [Seel] were just playing when the current sucked them in. [Misty] then tells [Mahri] to always be careful next time she goes swimming. As [Lapras] and the ship both arrive in port, the young man, who later introduces himself as [Rudy], arrives to embrace [Mahri], who is revealed to be his sister, and thank [Misty] for rescuing her by offering plenty of flowers. [Rudy] hands [Togepi] to [Ash], and then dances with [Misty]. He compliments the young [[Water]-type] [[Pokémon] [Trainer]] on her daring rescue of [Mahri], and asks if she could train the other [[Pokémon] [Trainers]] at his [Gym]. [Misty] and [Ash] are both awestruck that [Rudy] is the [[Trovita] Island] [[Gym] Leader]. [Ash] wastes no time in challenging [Rudy]. After a war of words, [Rudy] tells [Ash] that if he wants to challenge him, he has to pass a small attack test.
The group head off to [Rudy]'s speedboat, and [Ash] must knock down all the targets in order to challenge [Rudy]. [Ash] is successful with [Pikachu] on the first target, but [Rudy] is too preoccupied with looking at [Misty] instead of paying attention. [Ash] sends out [Charizard]. [Ash], [Pikachu] and [Tracey] manage to dodge a [Flamethrower], but [Misty] isn't as lucky, and she gets blasted. [Ash] quickly returns [Charizard], apologizes to [Misty] and continues.
[Team Rocket] shows up again, meanwhile, [Ash] sees another target appear in front of them, and [Squirtle] destroys it with a [[Water] Gun], causing a tree to fall and send [Team Rocket] flying. [Ash] then has an easy time using [Pikachu], [Squirtle], and [Bulbasaur] to destroy the remaining targets, and eventually passes the test. As night falls, [Rudy] schedules the [Gym] battle for tomorrow, and invites [Misty] to join him and [Mahri] for dinner, leaving [Ash], [Pikachu], and [Tracey] alone.
A few minutes later, [Ash] is talking to [Professor [Oak]] on the telephone, and [Oak] wishes [Ash] good luck in his match with [Rudy] tomorrow. [Tracey] then butts in and shows [Oak] his latest [Pokémon] sketches, while [Ash] and [Pikachu] sit down to eat their dinner.
Meanwhile, [Rudy], [Mahri], and [Misty] finish an exquisite dinner and head down to the [Gym] to see [Rudy]'s [Pokémon] working out by dancing to music as a way of improving their skills. [Rudy] and [Misty] get out on the dance floor, shortly followed by [Mahri] and [Togepi]. [Rudy] asks [Misty] if she would stay with him and [Mahri] forever. Given food for thought by those words, [Misty] stops dancing to think about it, while [Rudy] tells her to make her decision after the match tomorrow.
The next morning, [Ash] and [Rudy] are both ready to battle each other on top of one of the island's huge spikes. The spectators, [Misty], [Togepi], [Tracey], and [Mahri] included, watch from a hot-air balloon, and one of [Rudy]'s friends does commentary while riding a [Pidgeot]. As the match begins, [Ash] sends out [Pikachu], and [Rudy] sends out [Electabuzz], since both are [[Electric]-type] [Pokémon]. [Pikachu] tries to take down [Electabuzz] with a [Thunderbolt] and a [Quick Attack], but [Electabuzz] defeats [Pikachu] with a [ThunderPunch], giving the first victory to [Rudy].
Meanwhile, [Mahri] asks [Misty] what [Rudy] said to her last night. [Misty] uneasily answers that it was nothing important, but obviously, she's still thinking about the offer from [Rudy].
For the next round, both [Trainers] will use [[Grass]-type] [Pokémon], so [Ash] sends out [Bulbasaur], and [Rudy] sends out [Exeggutor], and asks for some music. [Exeggutor] easily avoids [Bulbasaur]'s [Razor Leaf] attack by dancing to avoid the leaves, then knocks [Bulbasaur] down with an [[Egg] Bomb]. As it looks like [Exeggutor] is about to deliver the finishing blow, [Ash] quickly orders [Bulbasaur] to use [[Sleep] Powder], which successfully puts [Exeggutor] to sleep, as well as cause it to fall off the cliff, knocking [Team Rocket] back down into the sea below. [Bulbasaur] rescues [Exeggutor] with its vines, and the second victory goes to [Ash].
Now, in the third and final round, [Water] [Pokémon] will be used, so [Ash] sends out [Squirtle], and [Rudy] sends out [Starmie], as well as dedicating the final victory to [Misty]. [Squirtle] and [Starmie] both attack each other with [[Water] Guns], and [Rudy] quickly plays some more music, causing [Starmie] to spin so much, it uses a [Thunderbolt] attack to knock [Squirtle] into submission, leaving [Ash] horrified. After thinking over the chance of a lifetime from [Rudy], [Misty] finally makes her choice: she yells at [Ash] to win since he can release [Squirtle]'s hidden power. [Mahri] is shocked, while [Rudy] loses his concentration after hearing [Misty]'s words. [Ash] orders [Squirtle] to fight back. [Squirtle] escapes the [Thunderbolt] with another [[Water] Gun], [Withdraws] inside its shell as it's about to fall off the cliff, then releases huge jets of water from its shell to fly back onto the battlefield. [Misty] realizes that [Squirtle] has now learned [Hydro Pump]. [Squirtle] uses its new attack and a [Skull Bash] to defeat [Starmie], giving the final victory to [Ash], who celebrates by dancing with [Squirtle] and [Pikachu] about how they need one more [Badge] to get into the [Orange League].
As the sun sets, [Ash] receives his [Spike Shell [Badge]] from [Rudy], who also offers [Misty] one more bunch of flowers. [Rudy] is now convinced that [Misty] wants [Ash], who doesn't seem to have a clue about it. And so, [Ash], [Misty], [Tracey], [Pikachu], and [Togepi] board [Lapras] and sail off into the sunset.


With [Ash] earning his third [Badge], he and his friends have now stopped on an island known to have larger-than-normal [Pidgeot] and [Rhydon]. [Pikachu] looks at the map and points at a mark, now inspired to look for buried treasure. The group runs into a fruit basket in the middle of the road. [Ash] goes for it, but [Misty] stops him, suspecting a trap. She points to a nearby fruit tree as an alternative, and as they go for it, they fall into a trap hole. One of the apples falls onto [Ash]’s head, and he tries to eat it, finding out it is a fake.
[Team Rocket] reveals themselves and how they used reverse psychology with the real fruit basket, causing [Ash] to pin the blame on [Misty] for her poor judgment, but she dismisses the subject and orders [Ash] to "find them a way out of there". [Jessie] and [James] send out [Arbok] and [Weezing]. [Ash] sends [Pikachu] out of the hole and attacks with [Thunderbolt], but [Team Rocket] uses special gloves to deflect the attack, and [Pikachu] is made dizzy by [Arbok]'s [Poison Sting] and [Weezing]'s [Poison Gas], respectively. [Meowth] then breaks out a pair of blue belts with red spheres implanted into back of them, and hitched to the spheres is strong white rope. Before [Pikachu] can recover, [Meowth] locks one of the belts around [Pikachu]'s waist and the other belt around his own waist. The Rockets then escape with their prize just as [Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] climb out of the hole, too late to stop the villains from stealing [Pikachu].
Soon afterward, [Pikachu] stands helplessly amongst the Rockets as they prepare to take him back to their boss. However, their plans are foiled yet again when a giant [Pidgeot] swoops down and grabs the rope binding [Pikachu] and [Meowth], with [Meowth] losing his electric deflection gloves in the ascent. As the bird makes off with him and [Pikachu], [Meowth] thinks that [Pidgeot] is taking them back to its nest, and he asks [Pikachu] if he can do something about this. [Pikachu] responds by using [Thunderbolt], and though he accidentally shocks [Meowth] on the first try, he manages to get the [Pidgeot] on the next try, causing it to release, sending them plummeting. [Meowth], saying that there's no way he is going to break [Pikachu]'s fall, attempts to use [Pikachu] as a cushion for the landing, but [Pikachu] tries to switch it around. After alternating, [Pikachu] emerges victorious and [Meowth] hits the ground first. This is not the end of their troubles, however, as the rope hitched to their belts leaves both [Meowth] and [Pikachu] stuck together in the middle of the island; [Meowth] reveals that [Jessie] has the key that unlocks the belts. Angered by this revelation, [Pikachu] shocks [Meowth] with [Thunderbolt].
Back where [Team Rocket] landed their hot-air balloon, [Jessie] and [James] wonder if [Meowth] can bring [Pikachu] back, but then say "No way". [Ash] and his friends corner them with [Bulbasaur] and [Staryu]. However, they quickly stop the [Trainers] and explain about the abduction. [Team Rocket] takes off in the balloon to search, and the heroes decide to do the same. [Tracey] sends out [Marill] to listen for [Pidgeot], leading them to [Pidgeot]’s nest atop a giant rock spire. Ignoring [Misty]'s advice instead of listening to her like before, [Ash] climbs up to the top, only to discover that the nest is empty. The [Pidgeot] subsequently returns and dive-bombs [Ash], knocking him off the spire and back down to his friends. Apparently undaunted, [Ash] gets up and continues to search. Both [Misty] and [Tracey] know how close [Ash] and [Pikachu] are and that [Ash] will not stop searching.
Meanwhile, [Meowth] and [Pikachu] run into a fork in the road and try to go separate ways, but the rope causes them to knock each other over flat on their faces. [Meowth] goes into a frenzy and angrily declares that they will be going in the direction he wants to go, but [Pikachu] threatens to shock [Meowth] again, forcing him to cooperate. After a moment, [Meowth] knows that [Pikachu] is in charge and tries to put up a friendly attitude, but [Pikachu] knows [Meowth] is deceptive and breaks it with another electric blast.
[Meowth] and [Pikachu] are still walking, when suddenly [Pikachu] smells something. A giant [Rhydon] comes up from behind and [Pikachu] tries to run, but [Meowth] is too scared. [Rhydon] attacks and [Pikachu] pulls them away and up the hill, with [Rhydon] in hot pursuit. [Rhydon] knocks them around and they make another run. They both fall down a cliff and continue running, but [Rhydon] is gaining. They get boxed into a canyon, and [Pikachu] chooses to fight with [Thunderbolt], but [Rhydon], being a [[Ground]-type], negates the attack. It prepares to rush and [Pikachu] comes up with a plan. Both [Pokémon] jump up onto [Rhydon] and [Meowth] tickles it to get it to laugh, and [Pikachu] fires a [Thunderbolt] into its mouth to knock it out. Both applaud the teamwork. [Ash] and the others find [Pikachu]'s footprints from the [Rhydon] struggle. They follow the tracks to the cliff, and [Ash] jumps down the cliff to continue looking. [Jessie] and [James] are still searching from the balloon without much success.
Night falls and both [Pikachu] and [Meowth] are hungry from fatigue. They find one apple on a tree and make a run for it. [Meowth] jumps for it, but [Pikachu] pulls [Meowth] down with the rope before using [Thunderbolt] to bring it down. [Pikachu] prepares to eat it all, but after seeing [Meowth]’s sadness decides to split the apple. [Meowth] realizes how nice [Pikachu] is and talks about how they could have been friends had things in their lives had gone differently. He thinks [Pikachu] should abandon [Ash] and join [Team Rocket], believing the two would make a great team. However, [Pikachu] can't hear him as he has fallen asleep in [Meowth]'s lap. [Meowth] simply chuckles "I can dream, can't I?" and goes to sleep.
The next day, the two wake up and the giant [Pidgeot] swoops down after them. They try to run, but the giant [Rhydon] cuts them off. Both prepare to attack, but [Ash] and [Team Rocket] arrive. [Ash] sends out [Snorlax] to stop [Rhydon] while [Jessie] sends [Arbok] to stop [Pidgeot]. [Snorlax] uses [Mega Punch] to send [Rhydon] flying while [Arbok] uses [Wrap] and [Bite] to send [Pidgeot] scurrying. [Meowth] runs up to [Jessie] and [James], but is crushed that [Team Rocket] searched for [Meowth] only to get to [Pikachu]. [Pikachu] runs up to [Ash], but [James] pulls on [Meowth] in a tug-of-war, [Ash] demanding them to let go of [Pikachu] while [Meowth] screams for [James] to let go of him. [Ash] sends [Bulbasaur] out, knocking [Meowth] out of [James]’s grip. [Ash] sends [Pikachu] to attack, and [James] sends out [Victreebel], which bites [Arbok]. [Bulbasaur] uses [Vine Whip] to send both of them flying back. [Jessie] loses the key and [Ash] grabs it, unlocking both [Pikachu] and [Meowth]. [Team Rocket] runs back to the balloon and prepares a cannon. [Misty] tries to send out [Staryu], but [Psyduck] comes out instead. The cannon prepares to fire and [Misty] orders [Psyduck] to use [Confusion]. [Togepi] uses [Metronome], which causes the balloon to explode and sends [Team Rocket] flying. They think [Psyduck] did it, but [Misty] suspects [Togepi] did. [Ash] and [Pikachu] hug after being separated. Meanwhile, [Team Rocket] is battered and hungry. They find an apple, and all three fight for it, with [Jessie] eating it all. [Meowth] misses [Pikachu]'s kindness.


The episode begins with [Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] riding on [Lapras] when they are almost run down by a boat owned by a boy named [Tad]. [Misty] angrily gets the boy to apologize for almost hitting [Togepi]. [Tad] apologizes and proceeds to call [Misty] pretty. [Tad] knows [Ash] from his victory over [Rudy] of the [[Trovita] [Gym]]. 
On [Tad]’s boat the gang is told by [Tad] that he is also trying to get into the "[[Pokémon] League]" and that he had been after [Ash] had battled for his [Badge] and that [Ash] had used pure power to win. [Misty] comments that [Ash] does not have any skill. [Tad] challenges [Ash] to a battle claiming that he likes to challenge people who know what they're doing. [Misty], however, jokes about this by pretending not to see [Ash] while [Tad] describes him. They then set a course toward [Cleopatra Island] which they presume to be deserted. 
[Team Rocket] however is on the island fixing up some sort of machine and spot "the twerps". [Tad] and [Ash] begin their battle with [Ash] choosing [Pikachu] and [Tad] choosing [Poliwrath], this [Poliwrath] is wearing a golden belt that it won from [Tad]’s local town for being the “most powerful” [Pokémon] there. [Misty] and [Tracey] are puzzled by this choice but [Ash] is none the less confident. He orders [Pikachu] to use [Thunderbolt], but [Poliwrath] immediately uses [Double Team] to avoid it. [Pikachu] then uses [Quick Attack] to get rid of the illusory [Poliwrath]. As [Pikachu] gets rid of the last one he uses his tail to shock [Poliwrath] however despite this [Poliwrath] seems undamaged. [Poliwrath] quickly uses [Hypnosis] followed by [[Water] Gun] to defeat [Pikachu]. [Tracey] explains that [Tad] let [Pikachu] use his power up so that when [Poliwrath] used its own power, it can easily defeat [Pikachu]. [Tad] cryptically tells the gang that his [Poliwrath] is at a higher level than [Pikachu] was. 
[Ash], not very phased by [Pikachu]’s defeat, tries to match power with power and uses [Charizard], much to the horror of [Misty] and [Tracey]. [Charizard] appears and looks ready to battle. [Ash] comments that he can handle [Charizard] but [Charizard] in turn, like normal, [Flamethrowers] [Ash]. [Tad] notices this and asks [Ash] if he is sure about the choice, [Ash] says he is but it proves to be a big mistake as [Charizard] flies off on its own. [Charizard] does nothing that [Ash] tells it and flies around trying to get [Poliwrath] with a [Flamethrower] and fails every time. [Tad] explains to [Ash] that [Charizard] may be powerful but he is unable to control it. The match comes to an abrupt end when [Poliwrath] narrowly misses with its [[Water] Gun] on [Charizard]’s tail and instead unleashes a powerful [Ice Beam]. It hits [Charizard] who is locked in a cage of ice all over, save for its tail. [Tad] recalls [Poliwrath] but promises [Ash] a rematch once he learns how to handle [Charizard]. [Tad] leaves with [Charizard] freezing and [Ash] seething from the defeat. [Team Rocket] watches the match noting that they know how it feels but they are determined none the less to get [Pikachu]. 
Later that night [Ash] is up trying to warm up [Charizard] from the ice cage, by rubbing [Charizard]’s hide until his hands are literally red and raw. He is helped by [Pikachu] for a while. [Ash] tries hard to make sure that [Charizard] does not freeze and eventually it wakes up. However [Charizard] panics when it notices its tail, and eventually gets knocked out once again. [Misty] and [Tracey], meanwhile, are away for fire wood but come back soon enough and notice the disturbance. 
[Ash] and [Misty] continue to rub [Charizard]’s back and neck while [Tracey] checks its temperature. It is still very cold and [Tracey] gets some fire wood and [Misty] gets a blanket. [Ash] notices that his hands are raw. He does not care, however, and continues rubbing, wanting to help [Charizard] heat up. [Charizard] once again wakes up and tries a [Flamethrower]. However, it does not work. [Ash] tries to get [Charizard] to calm down, even going as far as to let [Charizard] use its [Flamethrower] on him when he's feeling better. [Charizard] finally surrenders and agrees to let [Ash] help it unhindered. [Ash] talks to [Charizard] while rubbing, reminiscing that [Ash] has had [Charizard] since he was a [Charmander] and then when it evolved into [Charmeleon]. [Ash] admits he's not the best [Trainer] and makes a lot of mistakes but he's always trying to get better and hopes that one day [Charizard] and him will battle side by side. [Charizard] lies there listening to [Ash]'s kind words and remembers how when it was a [Charmander] [Ash] saved its life when it was abandoned in a rainstorm by its [Trainer]. It then remembers the good times it shared with [Ash] when it was still a [Charmander] and then how, despite evolving into [Charmeleon] and [Charizard] and growing increasingly disobedient [Ash] has still never given up on it. Meanwhile [Misty] and [Tracey] have lit up a few more fires and they and [Pikachu] help to rub [Charizard] to make him better. This continues all the night. 
In the morning [Charizard] wakes up to find [Ash] sleeping on him from last night and moves away from him without waking him. [Ash] and then gang awaken to a roar that comes from [Charizard] who shows [Ash] his tail flame which is just as strong as normal. The gang is overjoyed to find that the rubbing worked on the Flame [Pokémon]. However, [Team Rocket] attacks by causing an explosion that lets them trap [Pikachu] inside a giant drill machine. [Tad] also notices this and rushes to where the explosion came from. [Tad] rejoins the group just as [Team Rocket] says their motto. [Pikachu] is trapped in a shock proof box making his attacks useless. [Team Rocket] soon makes their getaway by digging a tunnel. Just as [Ash] tries to pursue them, [Charizard] flies alongside [Ash] and gives him a lift on his back. They fly after [Pikachu] through the tunnel until they come to the other end near a beach. [Charizard] uses its feet to grab the machine before it can go any further and pulls it back up the hill. [Charizard] attempts to burn the drill but [Ash] stops him to prevent him from burning [Pikachu]. Instead [Charizard] crushes the drill with his foot and then bites the box containing [Pikachu], destroying it. 
[Pikachu] is returned to [Ash] but [Team Rocket] is not done yet. They bring out some drill weaponry and attempt to slice [Ash], [Pikachu] and [Charizard]. [Pikachu] and [Ash] are knocked out, and seeing [Ash] in danger, [Charizard] learns [Dragon [Rage]]. This attack destroys [Team Rocket]’s machine and sends them blasting off once again. 
[Tad], [Misty] and [Tracey] finally find [Ash] and his [Pokémon]. [Tad] tells [Ash] that he promised him a rematch if he learned to control [Charizard], and [Ash] agrees to another battle with [Tad], [Poliwrath] vs. [Charizard]. Back on the beach, [Tad] sends out [Poliwrath] while [Ash] uses [Charizard] and the battle begins. [Poliwrath] starts with a [[Water] Gun] but [Charizard] is able to dodge after finally obeying an order from [Ash]. It flies around for a few seconds before unleashing an [Ember]; it sends multiple streams of fire toward [Poliwrath]. However [Poliwrath] counters with another [[Water] Gun] by spinning on the spot dousing the flames. Seeing an opportunity [Charizard] tries a [Take Down] but [Poliwrath] counters again by catching its leg before it hits. [Poliwrath] then unleashes another [Ice Beam] but [Charizard] successfully evades by flying toward the sky. [Poliwrath] then tries a [Body [Slam]] on [Charizard] but it misses by [Charizard] doing a spinning maneuver and [Poliwrath] is knocked into the air. [Charizard] carries it up to the sky and then does its dreaded [Seismic Toss] on [Poliwrath], winning the match for [Charizard] and [Ash]. [Ash] hugs [Charizard] and [Tad] recalls [Poliwrath].  
Over the sunset the gang waves goodbye to [Tad] with [Charizard] still out of its [[Poké] Ball]. [Ash] jumps into the air claiming that nobody will be able to beat him but accidentally knocks [Charizard] off balance while it is scratching itself with its leg. Getting angry, [Charizard] unleashes a [Flamethrower] at [Ash], [Misty] and [Tracey]. [Misty] and [Tracey] in turn tell him not to get [Charizard] angry, he says not to worry and that he could take the heat as the episode ends.


Arriving at the next port located in [[Ascorbia] Island], [Ash] and his friends are eager to get something to eat. However, their plans are shelved when they approach a warehouse on fire. [Ash] and [Misty] send out [Squirtle] and [Staryu] to douse the flames, but their efforts are in vain, as the fire begins to spread. Just when some debris begins to fall on the group, a team of [Wartortle] appear to save them, and proceed to douse the flames. Still, [Squirtle] is none too pleased.
Later that day, the team's [Trainer], [Captain Aidan], introduces [Ash] and his friends to his firefighting force: Teams [Squirtle], [Wartortle], and [Blastoise]. Team [Blastoise] is used for large-scale fires, Team [Squirtle] for tight-space rescues, while [Team [Wartortle]] is used in more general-purpose scenarios. [Ash] (after recalling to [Tracey] [Squirtle]'s past as part of the [[Squirtle] Squad]) quickly notices [Squirtle]'s attention to the proceedings, and quickly realizes that its firefighting confidence had been shot when [Squirtle] itself had to be rescued. [Ash] begs [Captain Aidan] to have [Squirtle] join [Team [Wartortle]] for a day of training, which [Captain Aidan] reluctantly accepts.
[Squirtle] proves to be every bit as capable as the head of [Team [Wartortle]]: in a running exercise, the two were able to outpace the rest of the team, though [Squirtle] had tripped over a pebble and rolled its way to the finish (setting a new turtle [Pokémon] speed record in the process). In a shooting exercise, [Squirtle] and [Wartortle] were able to shoot down moving targets with equal precision. However, one stray target leads the team apart from [Captain Aidan], and soon the team finds themselves falling into a [Team Rocket] pitfall trap. [Team Rocket] takes the captured [Squirtle], as well as [Pikachu] away, using [Weezing] as a cover, while [Ash] and [Captain Aidan] are forced to chase them.
However, their timing turned out to be rather poor, as an apartment fire has broken out, and an overturned truck has delayed Team [Blastoise]. Team [Squirtle] is on the scene, but is easily overwhelmed. At a loss and without [Team [Wartortle]], [Misty] offers [Staryu] as a stopgap measure, and [Tracey] is also ready to pitch in with [Marill] and [Scyther], while [Venonat] continues to search for the missing [Pokémon]. Back with [Team Rocket], infighting amongst themselves over the matter of whether someone should take a [Wartortle] for themselves and give the rest to the boss gives [Squirtle] and the head [Wartortle] the opportunity to plan their escape.
[Squirtle] and [Team [Wartortle]] flood [Team Rocket]'s cabin, and, while still trapped in their nets, manage to bunny-hop over each other to slowly inch their way out of the cabin. Now outside, they lure [Meowth] into having him scratch them free from their net (withdrawing into their shells to avoid getting hurt). As if on cue, [Ash] and [Captain Aidan] arrive on the scene, and a last-ditch effort to claim [Squirtle] and [Team [Wartortle]] by [Team Rocket] is met with [[Water] Guns] and a [Pikachu] [Thunderbolt], sending [Team Rocket] flying.
At the fire, even [Misty] is to her limit because [Scyther] has worn itself out, while [Staryu], [Marill], and Team [Squirtle] are unable to contain the fire. However, [Squirtle] and [Team [Wartortle]] arrive in time but just as Team [Blastoise] also clear the overturned truck. The troubles continue, as a child is found trapped in the building. [Squirtle] and the head [Wartortle] (with help from a [Blastoise]) manage to save the child, and each other; [Wartortle] from a crumbling floor and [Squirtle] from a falling door, while the fire is slowly brought to control.
In the end, [Ash] and [Captain Aidan] part ways, but not without a final salute to the fine firefighters in [Squirtle] and [Team [Wartortle]].


A week has passed since the events of the previous episode, and [Ash] and his friends have been unable to get off the island due to the fierce current. Food is getting scarce for our heroes, but [Tracey] at least concedes that their [Pokémon] will at least be well-fed, as much of the local plantlife is considered safe for [Pokémon] consumption. However, when they try to dig up some edible flowers, they come across a [Trainer] named [Gulzar] on [[Butwal] Island], who is none too pleased, as the flowers were part of a headband on his head. A series of faux pas made by [Ash] and [Tracey] lead [Gulzar] into challenging [Ash] to a match.
[Gulzar] begins by sending out a [Gloom]. Knowing that [Gloom] is weak to [Fire] and [Flying] attacks, [Ash] intends to send out [Charizard], but [Squirtle] is sent out instead. Sticking with [Squirtle], [Ash] decides to use [[Water] Gun], but it only manages to refresh [Gloom]. Returning [Squirtle], [Ash] tries once again to send out [Charizard], but [Snorlax] is sent out instead. Furthermore, [Ash] drops [Snorlax]'s [[Poké] Ball] onto a rock, damaging it. When [Snorlax] comes out, though, it is asleep, and [Ash]'s efforts into waking it up is of no effect. [Gulzar], desperate to get the battle started, tries to have [Gloom] attack [Snorlax], only for [Snorlax] to wake up, crush [Gloom] and attempt to eat the flowers of [Gulzar]'s head. [Ash], trying to send out [Charizard] again, tries to return [Snorlax], but as [Snorlax]'s [[Poké] Ball] is damaged, it cannot return. [Gulzar], fearful for his life, runs off and taunts [Ash] and company, by saying that the nearest [[Pokémon] Center], where they can have the [[Poké] Ball] repaired, is over a mountain.
After trying to tow [Snorlax] on rollers, [Tracey] hatches a plan to lure [Snorlax] into following them using an apple. Unfortunately for him, [Snorlax] manages to eat the apple before they can go anywhere. However, it does give the inspiration for [Misty] for another plan - by disguising [Ash] as an apple, [Snorlax] will be able to chase [Ash] as long as [Ash] can keep ahead of [Snorlax]. Though [Ash] objects to the idea (though he did originally volunteer as it is his own [Snorlax]), he does manage to lure [Snorlax] all the way uphill.
The downhill portion is considerably easier, as they had spotted a river nearby. However, when they set off downstream on the river, they quickly encounter rapids, leading to a large waterfall which they all fall over. Though they survive, they are lead to believe that they are drowning. Just then, [Gulzar] shows up again, and points out that they are in shallow water, where they can easily stand up. However, when they make the last leg to the [[Pokémon] Center], they find a large crowd there, angry due to the fact that their food shipment (which, as they are lacking an airport and due to the stormy sea weather) is being delayed. [Nurse Joy] manages to calm the crowd, telling them that the delayed shipment will arrive by airdrop. As the airdrop arrives, however, it is plucked from the air by [Team Rocket].
[Team Rocket] quickly ransoms the food shipment for [Pikachu], and [Ash] steadily refuses to hand over. Though the crowd gets angry, [Ash] is adamant, and surprisingly [Gulzar] jumps to [Ash]'s defense. Seeing that [Ash] will not simply give [Pikachu], [Team Rocket] propositions [Ash] put up [Pikachu] against [Meowth], who has been put in a super armor. [Ash] reluctantly accepts, but quickly gets into trouble as a [Thunderbolt] is easily absorbed by [Meowth]'s armor. Furthermore, [Meowth]'s armor has a mechanized "[Fury Swipes]" attack that easily crushes rocks, and [Ash] claims that his original terms were unfair. Taking this as a concession of defeat, [Team Rocket] demands [Pikachu], but before anything can be done, [Snorlax] reappears, having woken up during the ordeal. [Meowth] turns his attention towards [Snorlax], who is able to evade the mechanical [Fury Swipes]. In the process, one of [Meowth]'s mechanic claws get stuck within a rock and was detached, leading [Meowth] to use a mechanical [Skull Bash] (consisting of ejecting the suit's headpiece), which does not even faze [Snorlax] by a bit. A final desperation move, a mechanical [Body [Slam]] that sees [Meowth] ejected from his suit into [Snorlax] is also met with failure, and [Snorlax] is able to bounce [Meowth] off back into [Team Rocket]. [Snorlax] finally sends [Team Rocket] flying with a [Hyper Beam], and gorges on the food shipment itself.
Later, after [Snorlax]'s [[Poké] Ball] has been repaired, the stormy waters calm down, allowing [Ash] and company to leave the island for their next adventure.


The episode begins as [Ash] and his friends arrive at [Kumquat Island], a resort island where [Ash] will compete in his fourth and final [Orange Crew] battle. [Misty] and [Tracey] plan to enjoy their time while [Ash] battles. They are interrupted by a lady, who mistakes [Ash] for her son, [Travis], who had, like [Ash], started a [Pokémon] journey with a [Pikachu]. After clearing the confusion, though, the beach is attacked by a [Team Rocket] [Rhydon] robot, driven by [Arbok] and [Lickitung] and weaponized by [Weezing]. [Jessie] tells [Weezing] to use [Hyper Beam], but it instead uses [Smog]. It becomes clear that [James] had never gotten around to teaching [Hyper Beam] to [Weezing]. [Ash] then decides to put a stop to [Team Rocket]. In retaliation, [Jessie] has [Arbok] use [Poison Sting] on [Ash] and [Pikachu], which is stopped thanks to the woman, whose [Alakazam] used [Reflect] to block the attack, and then [Psychic] to seal the mechanical [Rhydon]'s mouth shut while another [Smog] attack is fired. This allows [Ash] to send out [Charizard] amidst [Team Rocket] confusion, who uses [Take Down] to deal a blow to the robot. When [Arbok] accidentally uses [Acid] to tear a hole in the [Rhydon] robot, [Charizard] uses [Flamethrower] to overload the [Rhydon] robot's machinery, causing the robot to explode and send [Team Rocket] flying.
In the middle of the ordeal, the woman is revealed to be [Luana], the final member of the [Orange Crew], and a local hotelier whose hotel includes a workout [Gym] and an indoor [Pokémon] stadium. [Ash] and his friends are invited to stay in her hotel's most exquisite suite free of charge, and they agree on a "[Double Battle]", to be held the next day, for the final [Orange League] [Badge]—in the match, both leader and challenger will use two [Pokémon] simultaneously. However, the match ends when the first [Pokémon] is unable to battle, wherein the opposing team are declared the winners.
While in the hotel's hot spring, [Ash] and [Tracey] discuss strategy. [Ash] is committed to have [Pikachu] battle, but [Tracey] surmises that [Alakazam] will battle. Lacking [Ghost] types or [Bug] types that could deal an effective blow, [Ash] ponders who else could stand up to [Alakazam]'s power. The next day, the battle begins with [Luana] sending out [Alakazam] and [Marowak] against [Pikachu] and [Charizard]. However, even before the match begins, [Pikachu] and [Charizard] are at each other; an innocuous stomp by [Charizard] had knocked [Pikachu] over, and the argument between the two escalated until the two were trading attacks, forcing [Ash] to break up the fight. Even as the match begins, [Charizard]'s [Flamethrower] manages to hit [Pikachu] while [Pikachu] was rushing towards the opponents. When [Charizard] tries [Tackle] on [Alakazam], and gets hit with [Psychic] in result, [Ash] has [Pikachu] assist [Charizard] by using [ThunderShock]—which promptly hits [Charizard]. This gives [Marowak] and [Alakazam] an opening to land successive [Bonemerang] and [Psychic] attacks on [Charizard].
With [Charizard] on the ropes (about to eat up another [Psychic]), [Ash] warns [Pikachu], standing still amidst the beating [Charizard] is taking, that if [Charizard] is unable to continue, they will lose the match. [Pikachu] finally [ThunderShocks] [Alakazam], freeing [Charizard]. In return, [Charizard] catches [Pikachu] after [Pikachu] is hit by a [Body [Slam]] from [Marowak] soon after. With the two now willing to cooperate, [Charizard] takes to the skies with [Pikachu] in tow, allowing [Pikachu] to land [Thunderbolt] on [Marowak], who had just launched another [Bonemerang]. The attack does not faze [Marowak], but it manages to knock off its concentration. Meanwhile, [Charizard] continues to fly towards [Alakazam], who was preparing a [Hyper Beam] to land point-blank on [Charizard]. When [Charizard] pulls up at the last minute, [Alakazam] is hit with the wayward [Bonemerang] attack, sending it and the charged [Hyper Beam] backwards. The [Hyper Beam] tears across the battlefield and into [Marowak], knocking both of [Luana]'s [Pokémon] out, and giving [Ash] the victory.
After [Ash] receives the [Jade Star [Badge]] for the victory, [Luana] tells [Ash] that he is finally able to compete in the [Orange League] against the [[Orange Crew] [Supreme [[Gym] Leader]]] for the [Winner's Trophy]. Leaving [Kumquat Island], [Luana] tells [Ash] that if should he encounter [Travis], he should deliver some greetings from home for him.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] are traveling along on [Lapras] when a submarine surfaces and a man named [Quincy T. [Quackenpoker]] comes out and sets up equipment. Suddenly they are caught in the middle of a migrating group of [Magikarp]. Mentioning that he believes he knows where the [Magikarp] are headed [Quackenpoker] sets off after them in his submarine. The trio decide to follow him to [Rind Island] and find out where the [Magikarp] are going.
When the trio arrives on the island they see the [Magikarp] swimming upstream. Shortly after  they meet [Quackenpoker] carrying a large heavy pack who quickly drafts the three friends and [Pikachu] into carrying it for him. He then introduces himself as a [Pokémon] watcher who has dedicated his life to the study of [Magikarp].
[Quackenpoker] sets up a tripod with camera programmed to record information on the number and physical condition of the [Magikarp]. He also explained his system of banding the [Magikarp] to reveal when each [Magikarp] left the island. The [Magikarp] are born in the waters around the island but once a year they all return to the island no matter where they are.
Meanwhile the group are being observed by [Team Rocket] who at [Jessie]'s instigation hatch a plan to catch all the [Magikarp] in order that they can train them into evolving into [Gyarados].
The trio and [Quackenpoker] then see the [Magikarp] swimming up a waterfall. [Tracey] postulates that while the [Magikarp] swim around the world they are building up their strength in order to scale the falls, although as [Quackenpoker] explains half of the school are still too weak to make the climb.
At the top of the falls [Jessie], [James] and [Meowth] are waiting with nets, having no money for [[Poké] Balls]. [James] catches one in his net, but it quickly escapes onto the bank. In an attempt to stop its escape they jump on it but are dragged into to water and over the falls instead.
[Quackenpoker] leads the group up the hill hurrying them along so he will be in time to see the [Magikarp] evolve. When they reach the top, after setting up his monitoring equipment beside the lake, [Quackenpoker] joins the trio for a meal. He comments that [Ash] and [Pikachu] have the most symbiotic relationship he has ever seen.
As night falls [Tracey] and [Quackenpoker] are discussing [Magikarp] habits with [Tracey] suggesting that the [Magikarp] navigate by noting the position of the Sun as they leap although [Quackenpoker] disproves this idea by showing a [Magikarp] that can't jump at all yet still finds its way to the island. The [Magikarp] begin leaping out of the water sensing something about to happen. However the water in the lake begins to churn and [Quackenpoker] states that something is wrong.
[Team Rocket]'s submarine appears, using long arms to pluck the [Magikarp] out of the water. However their greedy harvest quickly results in a glut of [Magikarp] within the sub and as a result it begins to sink and they are forced to throw many back. The submarine then surfaces and the Team recites their motto. After this, they begin throwing the [Magikarp] out of the submarine forcing [Ash] and his friends to catch them before they fall. Using their distraction they capture [Pikachu].
[Quackenpoker] stops [Ash] before he can order [Pikachu] to use [Thunderbolt] saying that the resulting shock would hurt the [Magikarp]. Agreeing, [Ash] selects [Bulbasaur] commanding it to use [Vine Whip], however by passing [Pikachu] between them [Team Rocket] are able to foil the attack, although in the confusion [James] got a [Magikarp] attached to his head. [Jessie] and [Meowth] try to pull it off without success until [Quackenpoker] intervenes, stroking its fin until it relaxes and releases [James]. While they were distracted [Ash] was able to grab [Pikachu].
As [Team Rocket] prepare to retaliate they were surprised when the [Magikarp] in [Quackenpoker]'s arms began to evolve before being followed by the rest of the lake bathing the scene in white light. The [Team Rocket] sub was sucked up into a massive water spout and sent splashing off again. The [Gyarados] and the remaining unevolved [Magikarp] swim back out to sea being followed by [Quackenpoker] and [Tracey] as they count the number of evolved and unevolved [Magikarp]. Just after the school swims out of sight, the sun rises and the scene fades out. [Team Rocket] is finally shown to be stranded on a rock in the middle of the ocean surrounded by [Gyarados].


While staying at another island, [Ash] and [Pikachu] prepare for the [Orange League]. However, their preparation does not go well. Walking up to [Tracey], who was examining "the most beautiful [Vileplume] he had seen", to ask for assistance, [Ash] trips, knocking both himself and [Tracey] into [Vileplume]'s head opening. The two try to struggle free, but [Vileplume] uses a point-blank [Stun [Spore]] on them. [Pikachu], unaffected, races back to their cabin for help.
At the cabin, [Misty] is struggling to help cure [Ash] and [Tracey] - they have no first aid aside from band aids, and the nearest [[Pokémon] Center] is on another island. However, [Tracey], in his weakened state, manages to get [Misty] to look in [Ash]'s [Pokédex] for advice - and finds that Salveyo weed has the ability to cure [Vileplume]'s [Stun [Spore]], and they are found on lake bottoms with [Poliwag] wherever [Vileplume] are found. Leaving [Pikachu] to take care of [Ash] and [Tracey], [Misty] and [Togepi] set out to find the Salveyo weed.
Meanwhile, at another cabin, [James] and [Meowth] have offered [Jessie] an apple to help cheer [Jessie] up - it is then revealed that [Jessie] had also been a victim to [Vileplume]'s [Stun [Spore]], caused when [Jessie] dove headfirst into a field of flowers right into [Vileplume]'s head opening. [James] quickly recalls that Salveyo weed can help cure her, which [Jessie] quickly admonishes [James] for. [James] and [Meowth] set off to find the Salveyo weed, but manage to find a [Poliwag]. However, their way of coercing the [Poliwag] to help them makes [Poliwag] run away in fear. At the same time, [Misty], having searched several lakes, has not found the Salveyo weed, when [Poliwag] appears. [Poliwag] warms up to [Misty] just as [James] and [Meowth] appear. [James] and [Meowth] demand the [Poliwag], but [Misty], seeing that [Poliwag] is hiding behind her, refuse. Seeing that [Misty] is outnumbered, [James] and [Meowth] proposition a battle, which [Misty] accepts. The battle does not go well for [Team Rocket] - [Victreebel] is juggled by [Goldeen]'s [[Fury Attacks]] repeatedly, [Staryu] cuts through [Weezing]'s [Smog] with [Double-Edge], and [Meowth]'s [Bite] attack manages to land on [Psyduck]'s head, causing [Psyduck] to unleash the headache-induced [Confusion]. [Misty], who had managed to ask for [Poliwag]'s help, walks away with [Poliwag] in tow.
Later, [Poliwag] has managed to get them the Salveyo weed that they need. Though [Misty] tries to say her thanks and leave, [Poliwag] is adamant that it follow her. As they walk back together, [Misty] tells [Poliwag] of how it can meet [Ash], [Tracey], and all of their [Pokémon] when they are cured. Encountering a series of items on the ground (including; make-up, food, dresses), [Misty] ignores them (with [Ash] and [Tracey]'s health as a priority), causing [James] and [Meowth] to wonder why [Misty] had not fallen for their four straight pitfalls, [James] then realizes that they shouldn't have guessed on what [Jessie] would have stopped for. A last ditch effort to take the Salveyo weed from [Misty] (with [James] disguised as an old lady with [Meowth] as the baby) is also met with failure, though [Misty] leaves some of their Salveyo weed for [Team Rocket] after [Team Rocket] is knocked off a cliff by [Poliwag]. [James] and [Meowth] are surprised that [Misty] would leave some of her Salveyo weed for them, but nevertheless takes it to help [Jessie] recover.
Later, both parties have recovered, and [Jessie], surmising that [Ash] and [Tracey] are still sick, decides to make their move in stealing [Pikachu] while they are still out. [Ash] and company's reverie is stopped by [Arbok] crashing through the cabin. As [Jessie] presses on her attack (without [James]' and [Meowth]'s support), [Pikachu], in self-defense, lands a [ThunderShock] on [Arbok] and [Jessie], paralyzing them yet again. Not wanting another conflict, [James] and [Meowth] quickly cart [Jessie] and [Arbok] off.
The day ends with [Misty] having a new friend and a new team member in [Poliwag].


[[Pummelo] Island] is now in sight. However, before [Ash] and his friends arrive, they notice a mysterious [Pokémon] flying around, which seems to be a [Dragonite].
On reaching the island, the first thing [Ash] does is register himself for a battle against [Drake], the [Supreme [[Gym] Leader]] of the [Orange Crew]. After having his [Badges] verified, he is told that his battle will be held on the following morning and that it will be a [Full Battle]. [Ash] is now ready to start training, but [Misty] tells him that first he needs to know where the stadium is. After being shown the [[Pummelo] Stadium], (which is very hard to miss) [Ash] is shown the [Palace of Victory] where all victorious [Trainers] are immortalized. But no one has beaten the leader in a long time, and the reason why no one was able to beat the leader is because his [Dragonite] was too strong to be defeated. 
The said leader is very disappointed about this. Though he doesn't have any time to dwell on it as [Team Rocket] have turned up to steal his [Dragonite]. However, one [Hyper Beam] later and they are already blasting off.
[Ash] is now ready to get into training. But there is a problem... [Snorlax] won't wake up. On consulting [Nurse Joy], she states that [Snorlax] probably won't wake up for several days. This means that it won't be able to battle. [Ash] calls [Professor [Oak]], who suggests using one of his other [Pokémon] instead. [Kingler], [Muk] and one of his [Tauros] turn up, and [Ash] decides to go with [Tauros] due to the "beginner's luck" factor that won his battle with [Kingler] and [Muk] back in the [[Indigo Plateau] Conference]. [Ash] puts [Snorlax]'s [[Poké] Ball] on the transporter and receives a very happy [Tauros] in return.
That evening, [Jessie] and [James] contemplate their humiliating defeat. A van drives past informing everyone that a challenger has been found who will battle the next day. [Meowth] likes this as they can get [Dragonite] when the challenger has softened it up a little.
The next morning, [Ash] arrives at the stadium ready to battle. After the customary handshake, the referee states that the state of the field will change after one of them has three [Pokémon] faint. As he says this, the flat field disappears and is replaced by a field with rocks on it and a pool in the middle. Outside, [Team Rocket] are more amazed at who the challenger is. But [Meowth] states that this will just make things all the more interesting.
[Drake] starts with [Ditto], while [Ash] starts with [Pikachu]. [Ditto] naturally starts with [Transform] to turn into a copy of [Pikachu]. [Pikachu] begins with a powerful [Thunder], and then [Ditto] uses its own [Thunder]. Next, they both use [ThunderShock] at the same time. The rocks begin to crumble, hurting [Pikachu] but not [Ditto], who calmly hops from one to the other. [Ditto] starts using [Agility], while [Pikachu] tries to shock it with [Thunderbolt], but no luck. [Ditto] then hits [Pikachu] with [Thunder], but it has no effect as [Pikachu] channels it to the ground with his tail. [Pikachu] then uses [Quick Attack] and [Ditto] use the same move too, until they meet each other in the air. Both fall to the ground, though [Pikachu] manages to get up and knock [Ditto] with his tail to win the round. [Tracey] realizes that [Pikachu] managed to win because he was in better physical shape. [Ash] has done really well to get past [Drake]'s [Ditto] but he still has another five [Pokémon] to face.
[Drake] is proud of his [Ditto] for battling and is proud of [Ash] on his first victory and tells [Ash] that he's going to get rocked by his next [Pokémon], an [Onix]! [Ash] recalls [Pikachu] and sends out [Squirtle]. [Drake] seems pleased with this. As [Ash] tells [Squirtle] to use [[Water] Gun], [Drake] tells [Onix] to use [Dig]. As the rock snake burrows underground, it dodges the [[Water] Gun]. [Ash] is now unsure as to what to do, finally deciding to send [Squirtle] into the water. However, [Onix] gets to [Squirtle] first, knocking it into the air before holding it in a [Bind]. [Squirtle] manages to counter this by using [Withdraw] followed by [Hydro Pump]. A final [Skull Bash] finishes the round.
[Drake] is surprised at [Ash]'s second victory, but tells him that he won't have a ghost of a chance against his third [Pokémon], [Gengar]. [Misty] and [Tracey] are worried as no [Pokémon] is strong against a ghost, so [Ash] decides to try his beginner's luck strategy and sends out [Tauros]. [Drake] thinks [Ash] has finally slipped up. [Tauros] uses [Fissure], but [Gengar] just jumps into the air, making the ground attack useless. [Gengar] then uses [Confuse Ray] on [Tauros], who starts running into the rocks. [Ash] has no choice but to recall [Tauros].
[Ash] decides to counter [Confuse Ray] with [Ice Beam], and sends out [Lapras]. [Lapras] avoids [Gengar]'s initial attacks by going underwater, coming out to hit [Gengar] with a [[Water] Gun]. [Gengar] then tries [Night Shade], so [Lapras] uses [Ice Beam]. The attacks collide and an explosion engulfs the arena. Who will be left standing?


Last time, [Ash] had begun his [Full Battle] with [Drake] for the [Orange League] Championship. [Pikachu] and [Squirtle] had already defeated [Drake]'s [Ditto] and [Onix] respectively; [Drake]'s third [Pokémon], a [Gengar], started things off by confusing [[Ash]'s [Tauros]] with [Confuse Ray], so [Ash] sent [Lapras] out in his place. In a collision with [Lapras]' [Ice Beam] and [Gengar]'s [Night Shade], it is unknown which [Pokémon] will remain standing.
After the explosion from the [Ice Beam] and [Night Shade] attacks, both [Gengar] and [Lapras] faint. [Ash] and [Drake] recall their [Pokémon], and with three of [Drake]'s defeated, a field change ensues. The commentator for the match remarks how [Ash] is the first [Trainer] to knock out three of [Drake]'s [Pokémon] in a row. In the stands, [Team Rocket] decide to capture [Dragonite] when [Ash] weakens it.
After the field change into a sandy desert field, [Drake] calls out his [Venusaur] and [Ash] uses [Tauros] again, who has had his mind cleared from [Gengar]'s [Confuse Ray]. [Ash] tries to start things off with a [Fissure] attack, but the attack doesn't work because the sand on the field absorbs the attack. [Drake] tells [Venusaur] to use [Solar Beam]. Hoping to cause damage before the [SolarBeam] is charged, [Ash] tells [Tauros] to use [Take Down], but [Tauros] is unable to damage [Venusaur] due to all the sand on the field. [Ash] tells [Tauros] to send [Venusaur] flying. [Venusaur] is sent soaring into the air. As this happens, [Venusaur] reverses itself in midair and releases its [SolarBeam] on [Tauros], but [Tauros] isn't down since the [SolarBeam] got him unstuck from the sand. [Venusaur] then launches a barrage of [Vine Whips], a few of which hit [Tauros], but then [Tauros] dodges the rest and hits [Venusaur] with a powerful [Take Down], defeating it.
[Drake] recalls [Venusaur] and sends out his [Electabuzz]. [Ash] decides to let [Tauros] rest, and sends out [Bulbasaur]. [Drake] tells [Electabuzz] to use [ThunderShock], but [Bulbasaur]'s [[Grass]-type] advantage leaves it unfazed and counters with a [Razor Leaf]; [Electabuzz] is hit by a few of the leaves but then deflects with [Thunderbolt]. [Drake] tells [Electabuzz] to use [ThunderPunch], and [Ash] has [Bulbasaur] use [Tackle]. [Bulbasaur] gets its [Tackle] in; however, after being hit by [Electabuzz]'s [ThunderPunch], [Bulbasaur] is defeated. [Ash] sends out [Charizard]. [Electabuzz] fights with a [ThunderPunch] and [Thunder], but [Charizard] stops its attacking with [[Fire] Spin] (incorrectly referred as [Ember] in the dub). [Electabuzz] attempts to use [Thunderbolt], but [Charizard] grabs [Electabuzz] and uses [Seismic Toss], defeating it. [Drake] has only one [Pokémon] left, and he removes the [[Poké] Ball] from his necklace and sends out his best [Pokémon], [Dragonite].
[Charizard] quickly uses a [Flamethrower] but [Dragonite] counters with [[Water] Gun], not only negating the attack but also striking [Charizard] with the super-effective move. [Charizard] then attempts to [Fly] upward, and [Dragonite] quickly follows. [Dragonite] starts to use [Ice Beam], and one hits [Charizard]'s wing and it starts to go into freefall. Luckily, [Charizard] recovers and goes in for a [Seismic Toss], but [Dragonite] escapes and turns the move around by grabbing [Charizard] by the neck. [Dragonite] then uses [Slam] and [Charizard] is sent crashing into the ground. Though weakened, [Charizard] refuses to go down and gets back on its feet. [Ash] commands [Charizard] to use [Dragon [Rage]], and [Drake] commands [Dragonite] to do the same. Both attacks collide, and the two [Pokémon] are sent flying back. While [Dragonite] is left fazed, it's too much for [Charizard] and it faints. [Ash] recalls [Charizard], thanking it for wearing [Dragonite] down. Indeed, [Dragonite] is already seen breathing heavily from the battle.
Knowing none of his [Pokémon] are on the same level as [Dragonite], [Ash] decides they will have to work together to it take out. He sends out [Squirtle], who is still tired from its earlier battle with [Drake]'s [Onix] and commands a [Hydro Pump], but it is knocked out of the air by [Dragonite]'s [[Water] Gun]. [Squirtle] is sent flying and then [Dragonite] uses [Thunderbolt]. [Squirtle] is able to use [Withdraw] in time to escape the majority of the damage, but is still badly hurt. [Drake] commands a [Body [Slam]], and [Dragonite] flies into the air and starts to descend. [Ash] tells [Squirtle] to use [BubbleBeam], and the attack hits dead on, causing the [Body [Slam]] to fail; upon landing, [Dragonite] slams its tail into [Squirtle] hard, knocking it out. Though [Dragonite] has knocked out two of [[Ash]'s [Pokémon]] in a row, its energy is slowly being taken down.
Out of nowhere, [Team Rocket] appears in their balloon and tosses a net at [[Drake]'s [Dragonite]], trapping the dragon. After [Team Rocket] says their motto, [Drake] grows furious with [Team Rocket] interrupting the match and commands [Dragonite] to send the bad guys blasting off again.
With [Team Rocket] out of the way, the battle continues. With only two [Pokémon] left, [Ash] decides to send out [Tauros] against [Dragonite]. [Tauros] is still tired from his fight with [Venusaur], but is still battle-ready. [Drake] commands a [Fly], followed by a [Body [Slam]]. [Ash] suddenly gets an idea and tells [Tauros] to take the hit, surprising [Drake]. The [Body [Slam]] hits, but doesn't have the intended effect. Using the sand on the battlefield to absorb the impact, [Tauros] has caught [Dragonite] in his horns. [Tauros] then throws [Dragonite] into the air and it lands hard on the ground. [Dragonite] gets up and hits [Tauros] with a [Thunder], knocking the exhausted [Pokémon] out.
[Pikachu] is [Ash]'s last chance. The electric mouse hops into the arena ready to fight, despite his early fight with [Drake]'s [Ditto]. [Pikachu] starts things off with an [Agility], but is knocked into the air by [Dragonite]'s tail. [Dragonite] gets ready to use [Hyper Beam], but [Pikachu] uses his tail as a spring board to dodge the attack. [Dragonite] is unable to move to due to the after effects of [Hyper Beam], allowing [Pikachu] to land on [Dragonite]'s head. [Dragonite] tries to shake him off, but the battles with [Ash]'s other [Pokémon] have left it quite exhausted. [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to use [Thunder] and [Pikachu] does so. [Dragonite] and [Pikachu] are exhausted after the battle and, after a staring contest, [Dragonite] falls to the ground, finally defeated.
[Ash] has won the match and is given the coveted [Orange League] [Winner's Trophy] by [Drake]. [Drake] congratulates him on a worthy victory, and tells [Ash] that he's a great [[Pokémon] [Trainer]], to which [Ash] responds that it's because he has great [Pokémon]. As well as receiving the trophy, [Ash], [Pikachu], [Squirtle], [Tauros], [Lapras], [Bulbasaur], and [Charizard] are given the honor of being inducted into the [[Orange League] Hall of Fame]. The episode ends with [Ash] hoping to tell [Brock] about his win.


As [Ash] and his friends continue forward, [Ash] is still fascinated by his victory at [[Pummelo] Island], staring at his trophy. [Lapras] suddenly senses something and makes a quick turn, swimming faster and demonstrating excitement. The group spots a school of [Lapras] ahead. While [Tracey] sketches them, [Misty] brings up the possibility that this school is the one [Lapras] belongs to. A flashback occurs to when [Ash] first met [Lapras] and how the group came together to reunite the infant [Lapras] with its group.  [Lapras] approaches the school and calls, but everyone ignores [Lapras]. One of the [Lapras], a teal-colored one, tries to return the call, but the others push it away. One of the [Lapras] attacks with [[Water] Gun] before using [Mist] to cover their escape. The group is stunned at why the [Lapras] attack as [Ash]’s [Lapras] cries out. 
At a nearby [[Pokémon] Center] on [[Tarroco] Island], [Ash] talks to [Professor [Oak]] over a videophone. [Oak] explains that those [Lapras] may be scared of humans due to a previous attack. [Officer Jenny] comes up and connects it to pirate poachers in the vicinity led by [Captain Crook], firing at the [Lapras] and attempting to catch them in a no-capture zone. [Ash] is furious and believes [Team Rocket] is behind it. However, [Jessie] and [James] are in the building recovering from attacks inflicted by the poachers. They refute the argument and deny responsibility. They reveal how a cannonball exploded near their submarine, sending it crashing onto the island and damaging it. Before [Officer Jenny] can pull up their files, [Team Rocket] flees.
Nearby, the school of [Lapras] moves on as the teal-colored [Lapras] looks out. A pirate ship approaches the [Lapras]. On board, [Captain Crook] sets his plan to catch them into motion. The pirate ship fires cannons loaded with [[Poké] Balls] instead of cannonballs. The balls release several [Tentacruel] to surround the group. They attack with [Poison Sting], but the lead [Lapras] uses [[Water] Gun] to block. The pirates deploy more [Tentacruel] to cut them off as [Ash]’s group finds the [Lapras] under attack. [Misty] realizes the pirates are merely using the [Tentacruel] to bully them as [Captain Crook] even verbally degrades the [Tentacruel]. [Tracey] and his [Marill] head back to the island to get [Officer Jenny] while [Ash] and [Misty] race to intercept.
[Team Rocket] follows in their [Magikarp] submarine as the [Tentacruel] surround the school. The captain orders all of them to attack, but [[Ash]'s [Pikachu]] attacks with [ThunderShock]. It does stop them, but it hurts the [Lapras] as well as [Ash]’s group since water conducts electricity. The [Tentacruel] break off to attack [Ash] as the pirates confront them, firing cannon rounds at [[Ash]'s [Lapras]]. It dodges quickly as [Ash] sends out [Squirtle] to join [[Misty]'s [Poliwag]], [Goldeen] and [Staryu]. [Misty] leads the [Pokémon] to fire [[Water] Gun] at the ship, destroying the cannons and masts, as well as putting holes into the ship. Crook barks at them as the [Water] [Pokémon] fire at once, knocking him back. The pirates ran out of cannonballs, so the captain fires [Scuz] at them, but the [Pokémon] stop him with [[Water] Gun]. 
[Ash] taunts the [Tentacruel], but it fails to distract them. [[Ash]'s [Lapras]] fires [[Water] Gun] at the leader, making it angry and prompting the [Tentacruel] to continue chasing [[Ash]'s [Lapras]], allowing the school to flee. The [Tentacruel] begin to catch up with [Ash]’s [Lapras], unintentionally crashing into [Team Rocket]’s submarine and sending them blasting off. The [Tentacruel] surround [Ash] and [Lapras]. Meanwhile, [Misty] has the ship under control with the crew bound. [Misty] orders the captain to call the [Tentacruel], but he refuses. [Ash]’s [Lapras] fires [[Water] Gun] at a [Tentacruel] as the captain orders [Supersonic] attacks. All the [Tentacruel] fire, crippling [Ash], [Pikachu], and [Lapras]. The lead rushes forward to attack, but the school of [Lapras] comes to aid, freezing the [Tentacruel] with [Ice Beam], sending them plummeting underwater. The school approaches and [Ash]’s [Lapras] meets with the teal one, revealed to be the mother. 
[Officer Jenny] arrives in a patrol boat, taking the pirates and [Team Rocket] into custody. [Misty] releases the [Tentacruel] while [Ash] and [Lapras] share one last moment before it rejoins the school. Flashbacks recount on [Lapras] participating throughout the [Orange Islands]. [Lapras] dives underwater and comes under [Ash], allowing him to get back onto the ship. [[Ash]'s [Lapras]] rejoins the school as they head off into the sunset.


[Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] arrive on [Hamlin Island] after releasing [Lapras] back into the wild. As luck would have it, a ferry line happens to run from Hamlin straight back to [Ash]'s home town of [Pallet Town].
On their way to the ferry [Ash] exclaims that he cannot wait to get back to Pallet to taste his mother's 'Deep Dish Chili Dog and Pizza Pot Pies.' [Tracey] says he can't wait to finally meet [Professor [Oak]] and [Misty] remarks that Prof. [Oak] probably is excited for when the day comes that the three bring the [GS Ball] to him.
The trio comes to a road bridge that is blocked. [Ash] reads aloud a sign which says 'Due to extremely dangerous conditions, persons are forbidden to cross this bridge.' With no other way to get to the ferry dock on the other side, [Tracey] suggests they cross it anyway. Just as he finishes speaking a huge [Explosion] blows apart the middle of the bridge.
The three find a row boat and make their way across the small stretch of ocean. [Tracey] checks things out with his binoculars and remarks that it appears as though there are no people in the town. Sure enough when they arrive they are greeted with a veritable ghost town. The trio walks past an alley way where the viewer sees a pair of devious white eyes watching them. [Togepi] feels a presence but the heroes don't notice.
The three enter the ferry's waiting lounge but come across a locked door which prevents them from getting out to the dock and the ferry itself. [Togepi] wanders out of the building whilst [Ash], [Misty] and [Tracey] are pondering how they'll get back to Pallet. As it walks out the door it comes across a playful [Voltorb] who rolls away. Seeing it as a game [Togepi] runs after the [Voltorb].
As [Misty] and co. walk out of the building, [Misty] sees that [Togepi] is not where she left it. They run out of the building calling for [Togepi], running straight past an alley here [Togepi] is walking on a rolling [Voltorb]. The three backtrack quickly when they hear [Togepi]'s voice and gaze in amazement of the scene. [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] for [Voltorb]'s data. The trio is shocked when [Dexter] tells them [Voltorb] may explode without warning, as [Togepi] is standing right on top of one. [Misty] attempts to pull [Togepi] off but [Togepi] picks the [Voltorb] up with it. [Ash] tells [Misty] that he feels as though they're not alone in the alley and [Tracey] agrees. [Misty] looks up where dozens of ball-shaped silhouettes are hiding behind corners. [Ash] again checks his [Pokédex] which gives data for [Electrode]. [Ash] and friends become worried when the [Pokédex] refers to [Electrode] as the 'Bomb Ball'. The [Electrode] begin rolling into view, all sparking with electricity. [Misty] picks up [Togepi], [Voltorb] in hand and the group begin to slowly walk back through the streets where they are greeted by even more sparking [Electrode]. A gust of wind knocks over a wooden sign, which startles the [Electrode] who begin to light up. The heroes start sprinting away from them; however the first [Electrode] causes a chain reaction of explosions. The screaming group manage to stay ahead of the explosions before they are faced with a wall of sparking [Electrode].
[Ash] exclaims the hopelessness of the situation when from on top of a building a man's voice tells them not to move. A bearded man wearing a coat and a cowboy hat throws out several [[Poké] Balls] which release [Diglett] everywhere. [Ash] looks up [Diglett] on his [Pokédex] and finds out that they dig tunnels under the surface. The mystery [Trainer] then tells the [Diglett] to dig the [Electrode] underground. The [Diglett] create holes under the [Electrode] who safely explode underground. The stranger tells the heroes to follow him.
Back at another building, [Togepi] continues to roll around on [Voltorb] while the group sit with the stranger around a table. The man tells the heroes that the island used to be filled with people and tourists, but one day a [Voltorb] managed to escape from a [Pokémon] electricity experiment. Soon after escaping the [Voltorb] began to multiply, and quickly evolved into [Electrode]. The [Electrode] became so numerous that they outnumbered the people on the island. The lack of space caused the [Electrode] to become irritated, and they started exploding causing mayhem on the island. People started leaving immediately and the town ended up deserted, which in turn put the ferry out of commission. [Tracey] asks why the man is still on the island and [Ash] suspects he may be a thief. The man laughs it off and introduces himself as [Poncho], a [Diglett] Rancher hired by the mayor of the town to get rid of the [Electrode]. He tells the group that he trains his [Diglett] to dig a large tunnel from under the small island all the way to a prairie behind the city on Hamlin. His plan is to have the [Electrode] roll from the island to the prairie, making the island safe once again and giving the [Electrode] freedom. 
After [Poncho] finishes his story a phone rings and is answered by [Misty]. It's someone from the mayor's office looking for [Poncho]. [Poncho] is told that he is no longer required, because the mayor's office want the [Electrode] gone today and his methods are taking too long. [Poncho] tells the crew that the mayor has already hired someone else to take care of the [Electrode]. The heroes ask each other who else could have been hired.A machine underwater approaches the island.
[Poncho] tells the group that they probably hired whoever promised to do it the quickest.
The machine hits the island and drives on with caterpillar tires. The group races out and are faced with a huge machine. [Team Rocket] appear and spout their motto. They tell the heroes that the mayor hired them and their '[Electrode] Eliminator' machine to remove the [Electrode] quickly. [Misty] asks why [Team Rocket] would want to help remove the [Electrode], [Jessie] and [James] tell them that they are getting paid well and they are planning on keeping the [Electrode] that they move. They retreat to the machine and race off to some [Electrode]. The machine's arms put pressure on the [Electrode] and force them to explode. [Team Rocket] begin picking up the exploded [Electrode] and put them in a container on the machine.
The heroes can't do anything to stop [Team Rocket] as they have a contract from the mayor giving them the right to remove the [Electrode] however they want.
[Team Rocket] gleefully continue exploding the [Electrode] and putting them in the container.
[Electrode] from all over the island make their way over to see what the commotion is and surround the machine of [Team Rocket]. [Poncho] notes that the [Electrode] are extremely angry and [Tracey] points out that the condensed explosion of the huge number of [Electrode] could destroy the entire island. The friendly [Voltorb] hops over to the front of the machine and [Team Rocket] decide to blow it up. [Togepi] begins waving its arms before they start glowing blue in an attempted [Metronome] attack. [Togepi] begins hopping up and down performing a [Splash] and [Misty] thinks that it may be trying an attack. [Tracey] and [Ash] brush it off and say [Togepi] is too young to know any moves.
[James] is having trouble hitting the rogue [Voltorb] and [Jessie] and [Meowth] give him a verbal spray. Despite his best efforts [James] cannot manage to stop the [Voltorb]. [Togepi] runs out to assist the [Voltorb] and [Pikachu] runs to [Togepi]'s side. [Pikachu] [Thunderbolts] the machine but as usual [Team Rocket] have shock-proofed the machine. [Team Rocket] advance on [Togepi], [Pikachu] and [Voltorb]. [Poncho] calls [Team Rocket] a disgrace to the [Electrode] wrangling profession and pulls out a [[Poké] Ball] from under his hat.
Out from the [[Poké] Ball] comes a [Dugtrio]. Again [Ash] checks his [Pokédex] and looks up [Dugtrio]'s data. [Dugtrio] creates a massive hole underneath [Team Rocket] which the machine falls into sending them deep into the ground. [Poncho] tells the group that the job is only half finished and releases all of his [Diglett] once more. The [Diglett] begin digging under the [Electrode] and cause them to roll into the tunnel [Poncho] created underground.
[Team Rocket] are sitting, moping about their defeat when the stampede of [Electrode] head straight towards them. The [Electrode] sweep [Team Rocket] along with them as the [Diglett] act as a conveyor belt to move the [Electrode] back above ground. [Dugtrio] leads all of the [Electrode] out to the grassy prairie where they jump around happily. [Poncho] takes the heroes to the prairie in his [Diglett] hot-air balloon where they watch the [Electrode] enjoying themselves. The friendly [Voltorb] goes to rejoin its friends and is followed by [Togepi] who starts crying when it must say goodbye. [Misty] tells [Togepi] that you can still be friends with someone in your heart, even if they aren't with you and the [Voltorb] rushes off to be with its [Electrode] friends.
Soon the island is reinhabited by people and the bridge is repaired. The ferry service is running again so [Ash], [Misty] and [Tracey] say their goodbyes to [Poncho] before boarding it back to [Pallet Town]. While they wave goodbye from the ferry, a familiar [Jigglypuff] appears, delighted to have a potential audience. The episode ends with the three heroes, [Pikachu] and [Togepi] all looking on to the horizon.


When the episode starts [Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] are traveling to [Pallet Town], they are all excited to be back, especially [Tracey] who is looking forward to meeting [Professor [Oak]] and can't wait to show him the many sketches he drew as a [Pokémon] watcher.
When [Ash] arrives home, [Misty] and [Ash] are surprised to see [Brock] waiting for them in the house. They are confused as to why [Brock] had left [Professor Ivy] back on [Valencia Island]. He gives no reason as to why he left and when [Ash] and [Misty] mention [Professor Ivy], [Brock] falls to the ground shivering saying "Don't mention that name..." ominously. [Misty] theorizes that she dumped him. [Mrs. [Ketchum]] arrives home and explains how [Brock] came here: She and [Mimey] found him on the ground in a grassland and took him home once she realizes who he was. Since then [Brock] has been helping around the house, with [Brock] fighting over the chores with [Mimey].
Whilst discussing dinner, [Tracey] insists on seeing [Professor [Oak]]. [Ash] is reminded of the [GS Ball] and shows [Mrs. [Ketchum]] his trophy, which she suggests she could use as a dumbbell.
[Ash], [Pikachu], [Misty], [Tracey] and [Brock] travel to [Professor [Oak]]'s laboratory with [Team Rocket] watching from a distance. [Ash] is welcomed to the house by his [Muk] who is crushing [Professor [Oak]] under his weight. [Tracey] ignores the situation and asks to show [Professor [Oak]] his sketches.
[Ash] hands [Professor [Oak]] the [GS Ball] and he puts it away to examine it later. [Professor [Oak]] then shows them around the [Laboratory]. [Tracey] sketches every [Pokémon] he sees and shows [Professor [Oak]] his sketches. [Tracey] nervously awaits [Oaks] approval, though he whispers to [Brock] that he "hasn't seen all the sketches so far but...". He is interrupted by [Meowth] activating a circus net that engulfs the [Laboratory]. Meanwhile [Jigglypuff] appears and tries to go through the net though it can't.
Inside the net, [Team Rocket] are in and perform the motto while doing a circus act. They try to steal [Pikachu], but [Ash] sends out his [Muk] to attack [Lickitung]. [Muk] ignores the [Lickitung] and goes on to hug [Jessie]. [James] sends out his [Victreebel], which again [Muk] hugs. [James] tries his luck with [Razor Leaf] but it "just didn't cut it." as said in the episode. [Victreebel] tries to swallow [[Ash]'s [Muk]] but it uses [Poison Gas] before it can use [PoisonPowder]. [Lickitung] slobbers all over [Muk] with its tongue but it does nothing. 
[James] commands [Victreebel] to use [[Sleep] Powder] on [Muk] which works, much to [Ash]'s surprise. [Ash] switches to [Squirtle] and [Bulbasaur]. [Team Rocket] then throws rings around [Ash], [Misty], [Pikachu], [Professor [Oak]], [Brock] and [Tracey] which stops them from moving. A [Super Sucker] then proceeds to suck in every [[Poké] Ball] that are in the [Laboratory], including [Tracey]'s Sketchbooks. [Meowth] asks again why [Brock] came back, though he doesn't give an answer. The last ball sucked in is the [GS Ball], but then a rip in the tent appears, caused by a mysterious man and his [Nidoqueen]. [The [[Meowth] Balloon]] falls to the ground, releasing every [[Poké] Ball] in it.
The mysterious man turns out to be [Gary] and the [Nidoqueen] attacks [Lickitung] by grabbing its tongue and swinging it into [Team Rocket]. [Meowth] tries using [Scratch] but it doesn't work, only breaking his claws. [Gary] tells his [Nidoqueen] to strike back, hurling [Team Rocket] into the air. 
[Ash] and [Gary] start a battle to prove who has become the better [Trainer] over the past months.


The episode starts with a recapitulation of recent events: namely, [Ash], [Misty], and [Tracey] returning to [Pallet Town], unexpectedly finding [Brock] with his apparent disaffiliation with [Professor Ivy], bringing the [GS Ball] to [Professor [Oak]] only to suffer from a surprise attack by [Team Rocket], and subsequently being rescued from their helpless states by [Ash]’s rival, [[Gary] [Oak]]. The narration then returns to the current state, in which [Ash] and [Gary] are about to battle.
A wind blows theatrically through the field that [Gary] and [Ash] shall battle each other in, and [Ash]’s companions and [Professor [Oak]] watch on the sidelines. [Gary] holds a [[Poké] Ball] up, and suggests that maybe the best way for them to proceed would be for each of them to pick just one [Pokémon], and have a one-on-one battle to the finish. [Ash] states that it is fine with him, and looks down at [Pikachu]. [Pikachu] appears to nod, and [Ash] proclaims that he is going to battle with [Pikachu]. [Pikachu] springs up and onto the field, and [Gary] states that it is just as he thought, adding that it is a good choice. [Gary] sends out his [Pokémon], an [Eevee]. [Misty] comments that [Eevee] is cute, but [Brock] states that looks can be deceiving, pointing out its shiny coat and bright eyes as indicators that [Gary] is raising it very well. [Tracey] agrees with [Brock], betting that it is ready to evolve into a [Flareon], [Jolteon] or [Vaporeon]. [Brock] claims that they should get the match started, and states the one-on-one conditions of the battle, ending with the statement to begin the battle now. 
[Ash] addresses [Gary] to pay attention and maybe he will learn something, like how to make the top sixteen of the [[Pokémon] League] and win the [Orange League]. [Gary] states that he is there to battle, not to talk, and implores what about [Ash]. [Ash] fervently exclaims that he is there to beat him, starting the battle by commanding [Pikachu] to use [Quick Attack]. [Pikachu] runs forward, and [Gary] tells his [Eevee] to use [Reflect] attack. A barrier forms around [Eevee], and [Pikachu] rams into it, dissipating it and sending [Eevee] into the air. [Eevee] lands without any discernible damage done, as [Tracey] states that he has seen a lot of [Reflect] attacks but never one like that. At [Misty]’s puzzlement, [Tracey] asks if it looks to her like [Eevee] felt the half of [Pikachu]’s [Quick Attack], continuing that it does not seem so to him, looking more like [Eevee] did not feel it at all. [Misty] states that she guesses it means [Gary]’s [Eevee] is at a really high level. [Ash] commands [Pikachu] to use [Thunderbolt] attack, but [Gary] tells his [Eevee] to use [Double Team]. [Eevee] performs the move, and [Pikachu] attempts to use [Thunderbolt] on all of them. As the illusionary copies vanish, [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to stop, for it is no use and to not waste his electricity. [Gary] looks to the side, commanding [Eevee] to use [Take Down] attack. [Pikachu] turns his head to the direction [Gary] looked in, as [Eevee] runs forward. [Ash] commands [Pikachu] to use [Agility], which stops [Eevee] in its tracks as [Pikachu] dodges the potential execution of [Take Down], with [Eevee] attempting to follow [Pikachu]’s movement. [Ash] commands [Pikachu] to use [Thunder] attack, and [Gary] tells [Eevee] to use [Skull Bash]. [Eevee] collides into [Pikachu], stunning him and causing him to release [Thunder] attack too late. [Pikachu] falls to the ground, weakened, while [Eevee] lands perfectly with no damage. [Pikachu] attempts to get up, but is unsuccessful and knocked out. 
[Brock] declares that the match is over, and [Eevee] is the winner. [Ash] runs up to [Pikachu], holding him in his arms. On seeing [Pikachu] open his eyes, [Ash] congratulates [Pikachu], saying it was a tough battle and he was great. [Misty] comments that at least they tried their best, and [Professor [Oak]] nods knowingly in agreement. [Gary] calls [Eevee]’s name, and [Eevee] scampers over with [Gary] lowering himself to pet [Eevee]’s head and congratulate it on the battle. [Professor [Oak]] walks over to [Gary], stating that it looks like all the training he has been doing has paid off, claiming that he is very impressed with [Gary]’s progress. [Gary] rises, thanking his grandfather but replying that he still has a lot of work ahead of him, and raises [Eevee]’s [[Poké] Ball] to spin on his finger. [Gary] tells [Ash] that he did a great job, and catches the [[Poké] Ball] he was spinning. [Gary] recalls [Eevee], and says goodbye to his grandfather as he prepares to depart. [Ash] stands up, and exclaims at [Gary] that next time it is going to be different. [Gary] continues forward, but raises one hand in the air as he walks, apparently in acknowledgment of [Ash]’s comment.
[Ash] is then seen sitting on a rock with [Pikachu], observing a herd of [Tauros] running past. [Ash] then reclines on the rock, staring up at the sky. [Misty] then appears in his line of vision, asking him if he wants to know where [Gary] is. [Ash] mumbles why should he care, but [Misty] remarks that he is out on a new journey already. [Ash], a little shocked, turns around to ask [Misty] where [Gary] would be journeying to.
At [[Professor [Oak]]'s [Laboratory]], [Professor [Oak]] is examining the progress of his devices in gathering information about the [GS Ball], with [Tracey] and [Brock] standing near him. [Tracey] asks if [Professor [Oak]]'s scanners are coming up with any information about the [GS Ball], and [Oak] turns to him, saying that he is afraid not and that he did not expect it to be quite so difficult. [Ash] walks up the stairs to the room [Professor [Oak]], [Brock], and [Tracey] are in, and inquires to [Professor [Oak]]. [Professor [Oak]] asks what it is and [Ash] states that [Misty] said that [Gary] is on a new journey. [Professor [Oak]] confirms this, adding that it is the reason [Gary] has been training so hard lately. [Misty] walks up the stairs, and asks if [Professor [Oak]] has been able to figure out anything about the [GS Ball] yet. [Tracey] states nothing so far, and the images of boxes of question marks appear on [Professor [Oak]]'s computer monitor. [Professor [Oak]] says that he is totally stumped, and [Misty] claims "If you can’t solve the mystery, and [Professor Ivy] can't solve the mystery" before [Tracey] taps her shoulder, and the two look back at [Brock], who is sullen from the mention of [Professor Ivy]'s name. [Misty] says "oops", and [Tracey] claims that he is just a [Pokémon] watcher, but that his advice is to watch what she says around [Brock], especially about "you-know-who", being [Professor Ivy].
[Professor [Oak]] states that he just cannot figure out who made the [GS Ball] or why, when [Ash] appears beside him and asks where [Gary] went. [Professor [Oak]] says to [Ash] that he thought [Ash] knew all about it, and picking up the [GS Ball], he explains that it seems his grandson has decided to head out west to enter the [[Johto] League]. [Ash], quizzical, asks what the [[Johto] League] is. [Professor [Oak]] responds that it a very challenging League, and that [Trainers] have to compete and win battles and [Badges], at a number of [Gyms] in the western territories to qualify in the championship. [Professor [Oak]] continues to say that [Gary] is planning to battle as many other [Trainers] as he can, in the hopes that with all the experience he gets, he will become an even stronger [Trainer]. 
Now outside of [[Professor [Oak]]'s [Laboratory]], on the field, [Ash] ventures out from the group. [Ash] states that he has to do that (emulating [Gary]) too, saying that if he is going to become a [[Pokémon] Master], he has to battle with the best so he is going to try for the [[Johto] League]. [Pikachu] jumps onto his shoulder, and [Ash] tells [Pikachu] he knows they will make it. [Ash] says that he will become a [[Pokémon] Master], and just has to start training as hard as he can. [Misty] affirms this, adding that ever since the [Orange League] [Ash] has been getting a little lazy. [Ash], angered, defensively exclaims to [Misty] that has not been getting lazy. [Misty] replies that if he had not been lazy, how could he have lost his battle with [Gary]. [Tracey] attempts to resolve the situation, asking the two to not fight. [Brock] claims that he guesses he should have known [Ash] and [Misty] would not get along without him. [Ash] and [Misty] simultaneously and defensively ask [Brock] what he is talking about. [Brock] explains that with him around, they will start training right, eating right, and fighting right, just like they used to. [Ash] implies that he infers [Brock] means to rejoin the group, but before he finishes his statement, [Brock] holds him and claims that [Brock] is back. 
[Brock] points to a direction, stating that they are headed for new adventures, new challenges, and new achievements, concluding with the statement that they are heading west. [Misty] says to [Brock] that is fine, but points to the opposite direction and says west is that way. [Brock] claims that what ever direction they take, they are headed for action. [Brock] then seems to punch in the direction of east along with [Ash], as [Pikachu] leaps down from [Ash]’s shoulder to emulate the punching motions. [Misty] says she will bring her own map before bringing her arm up into the air confidently. 
[Professor [Oak]] hands the [GS Ball] to [Ash], saying that he needs [Ash] to help him find out more about it. He explains that in a town in [Johto] there lives a man called Kurt, who is famous for designing special types of Poke Balls, and that if there is anyone who would know anything about what's inside the [GS Ball], it would be him.
[Professor [Oak]] then instructs [Ash] to take the [GS Ball] and head west to New Bark Town, for that is the place that all [Trainers] must sign up to compete for the [[Johto] League]. [Ash] agrees, saying that they will go there first, then take the [GS Ball] to Kurt in Azalea Town. 
Later, [Mimey] helps [Delia] with packing some things into [Ash]’s backpack. She mentions that she was on the phone with [Professor [Oak]] and heard that [Ash] was leaving, so she's going to be cooking up a big dinner for him and his friends. But first, the shopping must be done! A rather over-eager [Brock] once again tries to outdo [Mimey], and after a skirmish between the two, he charges victoriously out the door...without [Delia]'s shopping list.
Elsewhere, [Team Rocket] is dejectedly walking down the road, still smarting over their defeat in the previous episode. Suddenly [Meowth] notices [Gary] down the road, headed right their way, and the three decide to ambush him. However, [Gary] doesn't even notice them and walks right on by. [Jessie] and [James] are discouraged once again, and trudge onward, leaving [Meowth] behind (much to his annoyance).
Back at the [Ketchum] house, dinner is in full swing. [Professor [Oak]] presents [Ash] with a new model of PokéDex, explaining that the new model is loaded with anything [Ash] will need to know about the abilities, temperaments, and habitats of the new [Pokémon] he will encounter in [Johto].
[Tracey] says that it will be so great to see all the new [Pokémon] [Ash] sends back to [Professor [Oak]] and himself. [Ash] asks what he means by this, to which [Tracey] replies that [Professor [Oak]] is going to let him be his assistant at the lab. [Misty] says that she kind of wishes he were coming with them, but that she possessed a feeling he might wind up staying there. [Professor [Oak]] affirms this, saying that as soon as he met [Tracey], he knew he wanted to be his assistant, but it took a while for him to get up the nerve to ask. [Tracey] states that [Ash] taught him to always go for what you really want, to which [Ash] affirms and adds that the next thing he really wants is seconds, biting into the drumstick he was holding. [Ash]’s mother and [Mimey] come near [Ash], and release confetti into the air. Suddenly two reporters ([Jessie] and [James] in disguise) appear in the entranceway of the room.
The male reporter explains that they are there to cover the very special occasion live, and the female reporter, approaching the food on the table, tells the male reporter to get a close-up of the food. The female reporter eats a bit of food, and looks over the bewildered persons present in the room. [Delia] approaches the reporters and demands who they are, but the male reporter asks if she is ready for her close-up, to which she attempts to pose for. The two reporters then proceed to eat some quantity of food, but [Brock] approaches the female reporter and, seeming suspicious, comments that she looks familiar. On the female reporter’s reminder that it is live (L-Ivy-E), [Brock] is sullen and does not further interact with them. The female reporter states that they will now be capturing this charming [Pokémon] ([Pikachu] in specific) on camera, to which she instructs the cameraman to move in for a closer shot to grab him. The cameraman then presses a button on the camera, and a glove comes out of the camera to grab [Pikachu]. [Misty] yells out that they are not reporters as they crash through and escape by means of a window. 
[Ash] and [Mimey] go through the space where the window previously was to pursue [Team Rocket]. [Mimey] projects several [Light Screens] at [Team Rocket], but [Jessie] and [James] escape. [Jessie] and [James] meet with [Meowth], and [James] presents the camera, with [Pikachu] within, to [Meowth]. [Ash] tells [Pikachu] to use [ThunderShock] attack to blow his enclosure to pieces. [Pikachu] released [ThunderShock], but it is unsuccessful as [James] explains it is rubber-reinforced. [Ash] then lifts his arm with the intention of bringing out another [Pokémon], but a green flash speeds past him, being [[Tracey]'s [Scyther]]. [Tracey] commands [Scyther] to use its [Slash] attack, and [Scyther] jumps into the air before performing the attack on the camera case. [Pikachu] is then released, much to the fright of [Team Rocket]. [Ash] commands [Pikachu] to show them his [Thunderbolt] attack, and [Team Rocket] is zapped by the attack. [Tracey] brings out [Marill], and commands [Marill] to use [[Water] Gun]. [Marill] uses [[Water] Gun] on [Team Rocket], blasting them off. 
[Ash] attempts to proceed to thank [Tracey], however [Tracey] tells [Ash] to thank the [Pokémon], as they deserve the credit. [Ash] thanks [Scyther] and [Marill], and [Delia] reminds [Ash] not to forget [Mimey] who protected her garden from [Team Rocket].
