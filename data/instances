Meowth	pokemon	50	 everyone is shocked  and the elder believes that meowth needs battle experience to recall how to use pay day 	
Meowth	pokemon	13	 even though meowth argues that it won   t work  the villagers are adamant and take him to the stadium 	
Meowth	pokemon	76	 at the stadium  a huge crowd watches as they send out a nidoking to fight meowth 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth can only run around and avoid nidoking  exhausting him 	
Meowth	pokemon	27	 they check for coins  but meowth still hasn   t produced any

Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth fires a net as the swarm cries out 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth translates that scyther came back not to challenge the leader but to protect its brethren 	
Meowth	pokemon	2	 meowth even joins the pok  mon to attack  leading the charge  but scyther easily swats him away 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth tries to reel them all in  but snorlax is too heavy to drag

Meowth	pokemon	54	 jessie comes up with another plan to which james and meowth do not have much enthusiasm 	
Meowth	pokemon	21	 jessie  james  and meowth  spy on ash and his friends as this time  they have cooked up what they think is the perfect plan  in which they are actually standing a large trap  as they have put dynamite under the ground and once detonated  they will have trapped pikachu

Meowth	pokemon	86	 they hear the same bell-ringing sound  and the creature reappears and starts rubbing meowth's chin 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth mistakenly think that jessie or james rubbed him  but he finds that it wasn't them 	
Meowth	pokemon	35	 jessie split her hair in two  and meowth is biting onto james's head 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth then breaks out a pair of blue belts with red spheres implanted into back of them  and hitched to the spheres is strong white rope 	
Meowth	pokemon	29	 before pikachu can recover  meowth locks one of the belts around pikachu's waist and the other belt around his own waist

Meowth	pokemon	128	 however  their plans are foiled yet again when a giant pidgeot swoops down and grabs the rope binding pikachu and meowth  with meowth losing his electric deflection gloves in the ascent 	
Meowth	pokemon	45	 as the bird makes off with him and pikachu  meowth thinks that pidgeot is taking them back to its nest  and he asks pikachu if he can do something about this 	
Meowth	pokemon	74	 pikachu responds by using thunderbolt  and though he accidentally shocks meowth on the first try  he manages to get the pidgeot on the next try  causing it to release  sending them plummeting 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth  saying that there's no way he is going to break pikachu's fall  attempts to use pikachu as a cushion for the landing  but pikachu tries to switch it around 	
Meowth	pokemon	51	 after alternating  pikachu emerges victorious and meowth hits the ground first 	
Meowth	pokemon	96	 this is not the end of their troubles  however  as the rope hitched to their belts leaves both meowth and pikachu stuck together in the middle of the island  meowth reveals that jessie has the key that unlocks the belts

Meowth	pokemon	67	 jessie loses the key and ash grabs it  unlocking both pikachu and meowth 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth misses pikachu's kindness 	
Meowth	pokemon	24	 now outside  they lure meowth into having him scratch them free from their net  withdrawing into their shells to avoid getting hurt  	
Meowth	pokemon	99	 seeing that ash will not simply give pikachu  team rocket propositions ash put up pikachu against meowth  who has been put in a super armor 	
Meowth	pokemon	95	 ash reluctantly accepts  but quickly gets into trouble as a thunderbolt is easily absorbed by meowth's armor 	
Meowth	pokemon	14	 furthermore  meowth's armor has a mechanized  fury swipes  attack that easily crushes rocks  and ash claims that his original terms were unfair 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth turns his attention towards snorlax  who is able to evade the mechanical fury swipes 	
Meowth	pokemon	24	 in the process  one of meowth's mechanic claws get stuck within a rock and was detached  leading meowth to use a mechanical skull bash  consisting of ejecting the suit's headpiece   which does not even faze snorlax by a bit

Meowth	pokemon	43	at the top of the falls jessie  james and meowth are waiting with nets  having no money for pok   balls 	
Meowth	pokemon	12	 jessie and meowth try to pull it off without success until quackenpoker intervenes  stroking its fin until it relaxes and releases james 	
Meowth	pokemon	40	meanwhile  at another cabin  james and meowth have offered jessie an apple to help cheer jessie up - it is then revealed that jessie had also been a victim to vileplume's stun spore  caused when jessie dove headfirst into a field of flowers right into vileplume's head opening 	
Meowth	pokemon	11	 james and meowth set off to find the salveyo weed  but manage to find a poliwag 	
Meowth	pokemon	45	 poliwag warms up to misty just as james and meowth appear 	
Meowth	pokemon	11	 james and meowth demand the poliwag  but misty  seeing that poliwag is hiding behind her  refuse 	
Meowth	pokemon	45	 seeing that misty is outnumbered  james and meowth proposition a battle  which misty accepts 	
Meowth	pokemon	164	 the battle does not go well for team rocket - victreebel is juggled by goldeen's fury attacks repeatedly  staryu cuts through weezing's smog with double-edge  and meowth's bite attack manages to land on psyduck's head  causing psyduck to unleash the headache-induced confusion 	
Meowth	pokemon	166	 encountering a series of items on the ground  including  make-up  food  dresses   misty ignores them  with ash and tracey's health as a priority   causing james and meowth to wonder why misty had not fallen for their four straight pitfalls  james then realizes that they shouldn't have guessed on what jessie would have stopped for 	
Meowth	pokemon	99	 a last ditch effort to take the salveyo weed from misty  with james disguised as an old lady with meowth as the baby  is also met with failure  though misty leaves some of their salveyo weed for team rocket after team rocket is knocked off a cliff by poliwag 	
Meowth	pokemon	11	 james and meowth are surprised that misty would leave some of her salveyo weed for them  but nevertheless takes it to help jessie recover 	
Meowth	pokemon	53	 as jessie presses on her attack  without james' and meowth's support   pikachu  in self-defense  lands a thundershock on arbok and jessie  paralyzing them yet again 	
Meowth	pokemon	41	 not wanting another conflict  james and meowth quickly cart jessie and arbok off 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth likes this as they can get dragonite when the challenger has softened it up a little 	
Meowth	pokemon	5	 but meowth states that this will just make things all the more interesting 	
Meowth	pokemon	66	james is having trouble hitting the rogue voltorb and jessie and meowth give him a verbal spray 	
Meowth	pokemon	22	 he is interrupted by meowth activating a circus net that engulfs the laboratory 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth asks again why brock came back  though he doesn't give an answer 	
Meowth	pokemon	5	 the meowth balloon falls to the ground  releasing every pok   ball in it 	
Meowth	pokemon	1	 meowth tries using scratch but it doesn't work  only breaking his claws 	
Meowth	pokemon	10	 suddenly meowth notices gary down the road  headed right their way  and the three decide to ambush him

Raichu	pokemon	25	 surge then calls on his raichu  a pok  mon that has a personality very like its trainer's 	
Raichu	pokemon	72	listening to surge's taunts  pikachu decides that he is ready to fight raichu 	
Raichu	pokemon	54	 both pok  mon begin with a thunder shock attack  but raichu's is significantly stronger and does far more damage to pikachu than pikachu deals to raichu 	
Raichu	pokemon	147	 both pok  mon begin with a thunder shock attack  but raichu's is significantly stronger and does far more damage to pikachu than pikachu deals to raichu 	
Raichu	pokemon	55	 brock realizes that pikachu simply cannot stand up to raichu's more powerful attacks and recommends that ash withdraw pikachu 	
Raichu	pokemon	76	 however  when ash tells pikachu to return  he refuses and charges again at raichu 	
Raichu	pokemon	126	 the resulting trade-off between pikachu and his adversary leaves pikachu severely damaged by a mega punch and mega kick from raichu 	
Raichu	pokemon	39	 meowth suggests that they could steal raichu instead  but jessie and james decide that they should root for pikachu 	
Raichu	pokemon	11	 surge and raichu have already won  with raichu unleashing a powerful thunderbolt that defeats pikachu easily 	
Raichu	pokemon	41	 surge and raichu have already won  with raichu unleashing a powerful thunderbolt that defeats pikachu easily 	
Raichu	pokemon	60	 pikachu  however  is upset to have been beaten so badly by raichu 	
Raichu	pokemon	46	 with it  ash could evolve his pikachu into a raichu as well 	
Raichu	pokemon	42	 he knows that if he evolves pikachu into raichu  he might be able to defeat lt 	
Raichu	pokemon	15	 surge and his raichu after all when learning that lt 	
Raichu	pokemon	23	 surge had evolved his raichu the moment he caught it 	
Raichu	pokemon	9	 surge's raichu against ash's pikachu

Raichu	pokemon	108	 surge uses the same strategy as last time  but ash orders pikachu to dodge raichu's heavy attacks  causing raichu to give itself recoil damage from moves like body slam 	
Raichu	pokemon	34	 repeated body slam attempts from raichu all miss completely  as pikachu is simply too fast 	
Raichu	pokemon	34	 surge evolved his pikachu into a raichu too fast  it never had a chance to learn the speed attacks it can only learn in pikachu form 	
Raichu	pokemon	35	 surge  growing aggravated  orders raichu to fill the entire gym with a vicious thunderbolt attack 	
Raichu	pokemon	1	 raichu rips up the arena floor and even blows out all the windows around the arena 	
Raichu	pokemon	39	 surge orders another thunderbolt  but raichu is unable to muster up the electricity for it

Brock	person	17	after the test  brock questions the wisdom of the training program  believing that pikachu is already very powerful

Brock	person	9	 ash and brock are both stumped by it    	
Brock	person	63	 pikachu's electric attacks do not seem to faze him  which  as brock explains  is due to magmar using its own body heat as a thermal lance  diffusing the electricity 	
Brock	person	8	 though brock and misty advise ash to leave for another gym  as blaine was simply too powerful  ash declares that he will not leave without a volcano badge 	
Brock	person	34	the next day  as ash  misty  and brock try to help pikachu  team rocket manages to sneak into the battlefield  in an attempt to steal magmar by freezing him 	
Brock	person	90	 however  their over zealousness causes the battlefield walls to cave in  and ash  misty  brock  and blaine arrive as team rocket is sent flying 	
Brock	person	29	wondering where to go next  brock suggests that they head to the viridian city gym  which is a leading gym where the best trainers prepare for the pok  mon league

Brock	person	11	 misty and brock look at each other as if they recognize the cause  and misty says that they should go ahead and leave  to which ash replies   not until we help wake up blastoise 	
Brock	person	1	brock begins to tell the story from the squirtle and wartortle's point of view  with little pictures to illustrate it 	
Brock	person	1	 brock says that if it's true  imagine what things he could learn about breeding from being here 	
Brock	person	11	 misty and brock suddenly realizes what it is  and misty tells ash to get that thing as far away from her as possible 	
Brock	person	16	 then misty and brock know it's jigglypuff

Brock	person	57	later  after everyone has been treated  florinda thanks brock  noting that gloom is strong as it is  and that it does not need to evolve 	
Brock	person	105	 florinda states that now she has the confidence to run the nursery with a special someone  which causes brock to fall over

Brock	person	262	 after the realization that show business is tough  if only because of wigglytuff being irritable  pikachu  raichu  and vulpix dejectedly leave the stage  leaving only psyduck  misty claiming it was too stupid to get off the stage   who gets the part  prompting brock to claim that psyduck was only acting stupid

Brock	person	1	 brock and misty console him  though  as it is not every day he can take part in a movie  and he also met a rival trainer  katrina  in the process

Ash	person	256	 even gary has found himself a room  but unfortunately for him  his room entertainment is in the form of jigglypuff  with hitmonlee and electabuzz dressed up in costumes playing the shamisen   who puts him  the audience  hitmonlee and electabuzz to sleep  ash and his friends ran away before it could sing

Ash	person	46	 after quickly getting their clothes back on  ash and friends explore the secret cave  and find a metal door that's hot to the touch 	
Ash	person	177	 the local suddenly appears  revealing himself to be blaine  as misty had figured out another riddle  the answer being the wig blaine used as part of his disguise   and accepts ash's challenge 	
Ash	person	65	 confident that the fire-type leader will use his fire pok  mon  ash decides to lead off with squirtle  while blaine counters with a ninetales

Ash	person	28	 quickly down two pok  mon  ash decides to rely on pikachu 	
Ash	person	56	 pikachu's thunderbolt does not faze rhydon at all  but ash decides to take advantage of using rhydon's horn as a lightning rod  and another well-aimed thunderbolt at the horn knocks it out 	
Ash	person	20	when we last saw ash  he was locked into battle against blaine  down two pok  mon before pikachu had managed to knock out blaine's rhydon 	
Ash	person	1	 ash tells pikachu to duck in the last second  hoping to avoid the blast  but pikachu is hit  but fortunately is not knocked into the lava  having hung on to the edge 	
Ash	person	52	 though pikachu makes it back onto the battlefield  ash concedes the match  not wanting to risk pikachu falling into the lava 	
Ash	person	15	 blaine allows ash to stay  as the hot springs will help heal pikachu from his burns 	
Ash	person	31	 though brock and misty advise ash to leave for another gym  as blaine was simply too powerful  ash declares that he will not leave without a volcano badge 	
Ash	person	96	 though brock and misty advise ash to leave for another gym  as blaine was simply too powerful  ash declares that he will not leave without a volcano badge

Ash	person	1	 ash also tries to have charizard to pitch in  but charizard is unwilling to cooperate 	
Ash	person	111	 pikachu also makes an effort to help  while misty is forced to rein in psyduck and togepi from helping  while ash is forced to rein in jigglypuff from putting everyone to sleep 	
Ash	person	26	as thanks  blaine allows ash a rematch for the volcano badge 	
Ash	person	37	 but with the battlefield destroyed  ash and blaine agree to battle one-on-one on the summit of the volcano - blaine with magmar  and ash deciding to use charizard after it shows a desire to battle  he had originally wanted to go with pikachu

Ash	person	10	 although ash calls foul  blaine reminds him that  under the volcano  is still part of their agreed-upon battlefield 	
Ash	person	24	 having won the battle  ash proceeds to congratulate charizard and return it  only to be blasted in the face with another flamethrower 	
Ash	person	40	 as it turns out  charizard only obeyed ash in order to fight magmar  and nothing more 	
Ash	person	8	 still  ash had earned his volcano badge  and leaves cinnabar island

Ash	person	1	 ash and squirtle check out blastoise  and suddenly they fall sleep 	
Ash	person	89	 then  misty tells pikachu to  try an electric shock alarm clock   which manages to wake ash and all of the pok  mon up 	
Ash	person	23	 misty and brock asked ash what happened  who then replies that when he approached blastoise  he heard mysterious music that was vaguely familiar that caused him to fall asleep 	
Ash	person	129	 misty and brock look at each other as if they recognize the cause  and misty says that they should go ahead and leave  to which ash replies   not until we help wake up blastoise 	
Ash	person	119	 everyone tries to wake it up  but it eventually wakes up on its own  when blastoise's head and limbs pop out  lifting ash into the air 	
Ash	person	63	 misty and brock suddenly realizes what it is  and misty tells ash to get that thing as far away from her as possible 	
Ash	person	1	 ash looks at her and asks how bad it could be 	
Ash	person	81	 back on the island  team rocket chase the squirtle and wartortle around  and so ash's squirtle and pikachu try to wake up blastoise
