Relation Web
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $D$ be the set of descriptors.
    \item Let $R$ be the set of possible relations.
    \item Let $G = \left( V, E \right)$ be a directed graph where $V = D$ and
        $E$ is a set of edges such that each $v \in V$ has $|R| \times |D|$
        edges, one per relation per descriptor (exhaustively listing all 
        possible relations between this descriptor and all other descriptors).
    \item Goal: assign each edge $e \in E$ a weight $P(e) \in [0, 1]$ that
        represents the probability of that being a valid relation.
    \item Idea: as triples are processed, adjust the weight of not only the 
        ``explicit'' relation between the relevant descriptors that is directly
        stated with that triple, but also the ``implicit'' relation(s).
        % Knowledge graph?
\end{itemize}

Algorithm
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assume that we have a stream $S$ of verified confidence measures for 
        specific relations between two descriptors.
    \item We want to sequentially construct a relation web, processing one
        $s \in S$ at a time, updating the web for each new piece of
        information.
    \item Let $L$ be the set of labels.
    \item Let $D$ be the set of descriptors.
    \item Let $L_p$ be the set of all unique ordered pairwise combinations of
        $l \in L$.
    \item Let $C(l_p)$, where $l_p = (l_1, l_2) \in L_p$, be the set of all
        possible paths between $l_1$ and $l_2$, where each path is generalized
        to the labels on the vertices.
    \item Let $C_p(l_p)$, be the set of all unique unordered pairwise 
        combinations of possible paths between $l_1$ and $l_2$, where each 
        path is generalized to the labels on the vertices.
    \item Let $L(d)$, where $d \in D$, be the label of $d$.
    \item Let $L(c^*)$, where $c^*$ is a path in the graph, be a path with the
        descriptors replaced with their labels.
    \item Let $Corr_{l_p}(c_p)$, where $c_p = (c_1, c_2) \in C_p(l_p)$, be an
        assignment of a correlation score between paths $c_1$ and $c_2$.
    \item When processing a new measure $s \in S$:\\
    Extrapolation Stage:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assign edge $e$ specified by $s$.
        \item For each path $d_1 \xrightarrow{r_{1, 2}} \dots 
            \xrightarrow{r_{n - 1, n}} d_n = c_1^*$ that $e$ is a part of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For each path $c_2^*$ starting at $d_1$ and ending at $d_n$:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item (Recursively?) update weights along $c_2^*$ according to
                    $Corr_{(L(d_1), L(d_2))}((L(c_1^*), L(c_2^*)))$.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    Correlation Reassessment Stage:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reasses correlations ($Corr_{l_p}(c_p)$ $\forall l_p, c_p$) based
            on current state of graph.
        \item For each pair of labels $(l_1, l_2)$:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Initialize list of vectors $V$.
            \item For each pair of descriptors $(d_1, d_2)$ with labels $(l_1,
                l_2)$:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Construct a vector $v$ where each entry corresponds to a
                    label-generalized path between the descriptors, and store
                    the sum of the edge weights along that path.
                \item Add $v$ to $V$.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Using $V$, determine pairwise correlations between all
                label-generalized paths $c_1, c_2$, storing results in 
                $Corr_{(l_1, l_2)}(c_1, c_2)$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%Probability Representation
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Let the set $R$ contain all the relations between all possible
%        relations between all descriptors. 
%    \item Sample Space: Assign each $r \in R$ a value $0, 1$ indicating whether
%        or not that relation is valid. Let $S$ be the space of all such
%        outcomes.
%    \item Let $T$ be the set of all training triples.
%    \item Want to find: $s \in S$ such that $P(s | T)$ is maximized.
%    \item Assume perfect relation extraction from triples.
%    \item Let $R_E$ be the set of all explicit relations extracted from $T$.
%    \item Let $R_I$ be the set of all explicit relations extracted from $R_E$.

%Rudimentary Algorithm
%\begin{itemize}
%%    \item Assumptions:
%%    \begin{itemize}
%%        \item Triple classification is perfect.
%%    \end{itemize}
%    \item Explicit relation detection:
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item For each triple, label the detected explicit relations with their
%            probabilities (e.g., logistic regression confidence measure).
%    \end{itemize}
%    \item Drawing implications:
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item For every pair of descriptors $A, B$ find all non-zero paths $A
%            \rightarrow B$. Store these paths and their vertex labels and edge
%            probabilites in a data structure indexed by descriptor pair.
%        \item ``Collate'' the entries for every pair of descriptors of the same
%            respective labels, finding clusters of paths that tend to be
%            correlated with one another by finding correlation scores for each
%            pair of paths.
%        \item When processing a new triple:
%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item Update explicitly identified edge(s) with confidence values.
%            \item For each path this edge is a part of, update all correlated
%                paths by an amount proportional to this path's edge weights and
%                the correlation score.
%        \end{itemize}
