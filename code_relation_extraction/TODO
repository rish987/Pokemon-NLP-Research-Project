Automatic Relation Labeler
- For each of the chosen relation labels
    - write list of synonyms for the relation's action
- for each relation extracted from OpenIE
    - if descriptors and action match one of the chosen labels, label as that.
        - when matching descriptors, look for a match by searching through the
        list of descriptors in decreasing order of length, using the first
        match
- NOTE: This will not catch pronouns as descriptors, and depends on how many
synonyms we use.

- word embedding (Glove)
    - "turns into"? (multiple words)
