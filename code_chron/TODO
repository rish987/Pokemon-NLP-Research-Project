[OUTLINE]
+ copy over corrected labeled descriptors list
+ program for constructing episode-delimited raw data
+ program for constructing all instances:
    - for each episode:
        - find all descriptor instances
    - print instances to file with episode numbers
- program for constructing pivot dictionaries
- program for constructing all instance vectors:
    - for each episode:
        - construct all vectors for instances in that episode
    - print vectors to file with episode numbers
- program for testing algorithm:
    - input number of episodes to use as training data
    - use specified training data to train classifier
    - report results on remaining data
