TODO:
- implement sparse vectors
- nltk for POS tagging?
- openie?
Ideas:
1. implement/use existing HMM/MEMM POS tagging to improve existing pivot-based
algorithm
    - expand each pivot into multiple versions of itself, one for each of its
    possible parts of speech
2. do HMM/MEMM POS tagging, expanding standard POS tags to include tags for each
of the possible labels
    - note: this will lose information about the meanings of the tagged words
        - to address this, can create new tags for distinct verb 'categories',
        replacing 'verb' tag with these category tags
    - want to train on first few episodes, test on remaining
        - use corpus to identify POS of all non-descriptor words in first few
        episodes
        - train fresh HMM on first few episodes with everything tagged

HMM Training Plan:
- Brown corpus vs WSJ corpus?
    - Brown corpus because more general

Implementation:
1. 
- train HMM/MEMM on Brown corpus
- expand all of the pivots into multiple parts of speech
- tokenization to identify multi-word proper nouns 
- two passes of tagging:
    - first pass: tag descriptors
    - second pass: do all other tags with HMM/MEMM, considering descriptors as
    nouns to help the classifier
- vectorization ex: [Ash]:descriptor [sent]:verb [out]:preposition *Pikachu*
[who]:pronoun [used]:verb [Hyper_Beam]:descriptor [on]:preposition
[the]:article [tree]:noun.
    - want to identify descriptors as only 'descriptors' (not their actual
    labels) because the test data has no knowledge of the labels of its
    instances, and allowing for this knowledge in the training data will make
    the vectors much different than those from the test data; this will very
    likely hurt performance
2. 
- two passes of tagging on training episodes:
    - first pass: tag all descriptors with their label
    - second pass: tag POS of remaining words, considering descriptors as nouns
- train HMM on tagged text
- test on remaining text, error rate based only on tagging of descriptors

3? Combine results of 1 and 2:
- compare weighted confidence values of logistic regression and HMM/MEMM to
decide on a label

Question: Backtrack to previous part, implementing MEMM for identifying
descriptors? (not yet)
