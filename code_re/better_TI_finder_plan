Finding triples indicating a specific relation
- Initialize empty list of f/b keywords and f/b pairs
- User inputs name of relation
- User inputs one keyword common to this relation
- Program finds all triples with this keyword (1)
- User selects all triples that are "correct" according to the current relation
- Program finds all unseen triples containing *descriptors* (not labels)
    on either side of triples selected in previous step.
- User selects correct triples again.
- Program extracts keywords and pairs.

(going deeper into iteration)
- for each keyword extracted previously (and not already used as
        "input" keyword)
- give user option to ignore if garbage keyword
- return to instruction (1)
