For applying action detection:
- is this word surrounded by two descriptors at a distance under specified
threshold?
- handling commas - remove portion of text before comma and after descriptor,
    then run same thresholding function
- handling sentence with "Tracey postulates..."
- Word2Vec: closeness of normalized sum of interior words to previously
identified vectors of this label within predefined threshold?
- sequential classifier to draw new relationships?
- plug triples directly into CRF?
